By scheduling a message you can be sure it’s delivered at an appropriate time.\n* Send reminders to family members who need to take medicine at certain times throughout the day.\n* Something really important comes to mind and you want to let your partner know. Only problem is your partner is taking a test until 2pm. Easily schedule this message so you don’t forget to send later on.\n* Send automatic Happy Birthdays and Happy Anniversaries.\n\nWe all get busy and we all forget. Avoid potential issues by scheduling your messages when they are fresh on your mind!\n\n\n\nKairos 2 was written from the ground up to provide a better experience all around. Although a lot of it is behind the scenes stuff you can’t see, you’ll be able to feel and see the improvements.\n\n\n\nThat’s right, quickly schedule messages which repeatedly send on your chosen days of the week.\n\n“I don’t want to seem like a robot though! :(” — concerned user.\n\nWith that thought in mind, Kairos 2 introduces randomized send time for repeating messages. All you have to do is configure the earliest and latest time a message can be sent. Kairos will automatically choose a random time between those two points to keep your messages looking authentic and human sent.\n\n\n\nSometimes you for whatever reason need to turn on airplane mode. Without really thinking about it, you forget you also had a message scheduled to send. With this option enabled, Kairos will automatically disable airplane mode long enough to send the message and then enable it.\n\n\n\nWhen using this option, you can set a certain battery percentage threshold at which messages scheduled within the hour will automatically be sent. Get those messages sent just in case your phone dies!\n\n\n\nOne of the most noticeable things you’ll notice is the new user interface. Instead of looking like an addition sitting on top of the Messages app, the new UI looks and feels like it belongs.\n\nAll settings can be configured from the Settings app"
