					"markdown": "Compatible with iOS 10\n\nContactifier is a simple MobileSubstrate Tweak, that makes the Messages app more convenient. Basically what this tweak does is that it append additional info after detected phone number inside message balloon, if the given phone number can be found inside the address book of the device. I found this tweak pretty useful when i receive sms messages from my operator like \"The number 123456789 that you have tried to contact is back online.\". With the help of the tweak the message becomes \"The number 123456789 (John Smith) that you have tried to contact is back online.\"\n\nThe new feature \"Close Matching\", takes action when no exact match of the given phone number can be found inside address book. \"Close Matching\" evaluates each contact from address book with a \"match score\" and the one contact with the best match score is considered to be the searched contact, it its score is above \"close match threshold\". Match scores are received from comparing against searched phone number starting from the back to the front (in reverse).\n\nContactifier works with both SMS and iMessages.\n\nNOTE: This tweak does not alter messages stored in your phone! It is just showing them with additional info.\n\nConfigure options from Settings."
