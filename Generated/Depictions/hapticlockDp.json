Haptic feedback plays for each digit of the time, and this means you can tell the time without getting your phone out or looking at it. (Useful in a meeting or in class.) Hardware actions are recommended, for example, pressing both volume buttons together. This means you can activate the tweak through your pocket.\n\nAn example of a time being played: 12:41 would be: one small pop, then a small pause, then two more pops, then a bigger pause, then 4 pops, then a pause and finally one more pop.\nConfigure Activator from Settings.\n\nNo Screenshots for this item."
