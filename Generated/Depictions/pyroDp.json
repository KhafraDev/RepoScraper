If you're running a lower version of Tinder, there's no need to update. <br>\n<br>\nAlso, the reason \"last active\" is showing \"two years ago\" is because Tinder's server is currently returning that date for each user. Let's hope it's only temporary!<br>\n<br>\n* Removed features for the old style cards, which have been removed in the latest version<br>\n* Updated Auto-like to work with the latest version of Tinder<br>\n\n* Updated \"auto-like\", \"show last active\" and \"banner style matches\" to work with the new cards introduced in 7.0.1<br>\n* Added option to toggle between the new and old cards<br>\n\n* Updated show user profile from the matches list to work for version 7.0.0 of Tinder<br>\n<br>\n* Fixed an app launch issue some people were experiencing after the latest version<Br>\n* Fixed an issue where a user's distance was sometimes displayed incorrectly on their profile<br>\n<br>\n* Added option to disable super like while swiping<br>\n* Auto-like and banner matches have been disabled for group cards due to some issues found<br>"
