Configure in the Settings app (General → Spotlight Search → Hide Apps).\n\nFrom my testings it seems to be like this:\n\nHiding an app on iOS 9 results in another one appearing.\n\nHiding an app on iOS 10 results in an empty slot. I've tried to force iOS to fill the slot with the next most used app, but didn't find a way. Feel free to make a pull request on git if you find a way.\n\nRequested on reddit by /u/adamjaydee.\n\nSource code available.\n\nNo Screenshots for this item."
