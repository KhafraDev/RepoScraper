Personalize your device even more by customizing every little detail of badges, close boxes and even the new dots.\n\nWith Badgomizer you can fine tune the accessories:\n-\tColor\n-\tShape\n-\tPosition\n-\tSize\n-\tRotation\n-\tOpacity\n\nYou can also add border or glow to the icon accessories.\n\nFor each of the icon accessories you can choose from many presets or set your own custom values. You can create themes and share them. There are already 10 ready to use themes included. Conditional themes allow you to change just the accessories which badge value is equal or exceeds your predefined one. And if you can’t decide how to customize the accessories then just use the random function to randomize the values.\nChange the standard iOS style badges, close boxes and new dots to completely custom ones.\nThe only limit is your imagination, take full control and change the boring accessories to fancy ones.\n\nBadgomizer does NOT require Winterboard.\n\nWorks on all iOS devices with iOS 8.0+.\nConfigure options from Settings app"
