You can choose from many different predefined animations and adjust the animations duration precisely for your needs. And if you canâ€™t decide which animation to choose then just use the random function to get a different animation every time.\n\nAdditionally, with Per App animations it is even possible to animate just the individual icons or folders that you want.\n\n\nWorks on all iOS devices with iOS 8.0+.\n\nConfigure options from Settings app"
