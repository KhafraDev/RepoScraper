Hide it and be done with it.\n\nChange While Dragging:\nThe ability to make the current page coincides with the position of your finger. If you start swiping from the left side of the Status Bar and moving your finger to the right, it will change from the Today view to the Notification view.\n\nAutomode:\nYou can choose to display the Notification view if and only if any notifications are present, and otherwise go directly to the Today view.\n\nDefault section:\nChoose to always show the Today view or the Notification view.\n\nChevron Icon:\nOverride the default behavior of the chevron icon by having it show the one pointing upwards, downwards or being a straight line.\n\n\n\nChange While Dragging:\nIf you start swiping from the left side bottom side and moving your finger to the right, it will change from the Toggles page to the Media page. Should theoretically work with more pages, but not tested.\n\nAutomode:\nYou can choose to display the Media page if and only if any media is playing, and otherwise go directly to the Toggles page.\n\nDefault section:\nChoose to always show the Toggles page or the Media page.\n\n\n\nAutomode:\nYou can choose to display the Main page if and only if any notification is present, and otherwise show the Today page.\n\nDefault section:\nChoose to always show the Main page or the Today page.\n\nSource code available."

I'm aware of this but have no more time at the moment to test it further (finals next week).<br>"
