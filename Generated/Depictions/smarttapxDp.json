This will use some battery during idle times. However, on iOS 11, the built-in power management appears to be epic, so even with the digitizer constantly on, there is a huge improvement compared to older iOS versions! There are options in the settings to schedule the hours when you need the tweak most in order to maintain more battery, set timeout of inactivity or disable idle sleep prevention.\n\n- It can even be used on iPhone X to extend its touch gesture while the screen is off.\n\nCompatible Devices: All iOS 11 devices.\n\n\n\nSee larger Screenshots below.."
