This is the last update on Bigboss - please follow me on Twitter @jammytea2 to purchase and for further updates**\nStencil requires Anemone and works on iOS 8 upwards. This update is streamlined for iOS11,  and removes certain elements now available elsewhere.\n\nThis package includes the main theme and a glyph variant, plus four alts of each with different shadings and fills.\n\nIncluded are:\n• 1,100+ themed icons. AppStore and Cydia icons in 2 main themes and 8 alt versions\n• Folder background\n• Respring logo\n• Settings and share sheet icons in main and glyph versions\n• Customised icons for Apple Weather UI, which also feeds into Forecast, Twig, SimpleLS\n• Wallpapers\n• 21 background tints, each with its own folder icon and background. Each alt of the theme interacts differently with the tints, to create over 200 possible variations. Experiment with stacking to find your favourite! With Anemone's alt icon selecter, you can activate multiple versions and customise each app.\n\nEach version of the theme and/or background has its own:\n• Badges\n• Page dots\n• Status bar\n• Activity spinners\n\nUnthemed icons stick out a mile, so I'm happy to take icon requests. Tweet meor use the.\n\nUpcoming:\n• Full ios11 theming for a couple of newly added elements\n• Control center\n• More icons!\n\nFollow me on Twitter () for access to my public Dropbox, where you can download extra parts of the theme for ios9 and 10, plus a few other random bits"
