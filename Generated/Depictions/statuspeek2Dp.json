This package was designed to mimic Android functionality and allow you to easily take a peek at your StatusBar in fullscreen apps by simply pulling down from the top of your screen. It replaces the boring and useless notification center grabber that usually greets you when performing the aforementioned action (first screenshot) and provides an unobtrusive StatusBar (second screenshot) just one swipe away, without having to quit your active application.\n\nThe tweak features a small preference panel that includes an option to switch between a dark blur with white text and a light blur with dark text appearance."
