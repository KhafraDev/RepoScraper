I am not sure what is causing this error as this tweak is compiled for armv7/arm64 devices and is a random bug on older/newer iOS's and devices without reason. If this update does not fix the error for the users affected please downgrade to Safari Tools v1.1. This bug may be caused by PreferenceLoader but I can not be sure. <br>\n<br>\nThe most confusing part would be for example that this works for one iPhone 6, iOS 10 but then another user with the same device and iOS would get an error..<br>\n<br>\nPlease follow me on Twitter for support, updates and feedback!<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nv1.2 (New options/Cleaner)<br>\n<br>\n- Sticky toolbar <br>\n- Settings is now catergorized, nice and clean<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nv1.1 (More customizations) <br>\n<br>\n- Hide cloud tabs<br>\n- Disable swipe to go back/forward<br>\n- Block pop ups/Redirect to AppStore<br>"
