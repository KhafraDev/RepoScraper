Now you can swipe up on any folder to find out!\n\nYou can choose to show static, dynamic, or total disk usage. By default, usage is shown for all contained apps and subfolders, each sorted by size in descending order, allowing you to get a quick look at what's eating your disk space. The display of app/subfolder usage can be individually disabled, or sorted by other criteria. Disabling both will simply show the folder usage.\n\nYou can optionally view your entire device usage by swiping up on your home screen, and can choose to view that usage as-is, or group it by Home Screen and Dock. Note that it may take several seconds to calculate and display device usage.\n\nTo squeeze more information into the window, you can customize the display by choosing from a selection of font and indent sizes. Enable the Copy button if you would like to be able to copy the results to the pasteboard.\n\nA Flipswitch toggle is provided for quickly enabling or disabling the tweak.\n\nConfigure options from Settings."
