You can also specify to not show the dock above keyboard and remove it from the app switcher !\n\nFollow me on Twitter for news about this or other apps ;) Enjoy !"

The rest of the bottom is for original X gestures<br>\n- Split View has been added ! If the option is activated into the settings, you’ll be able to split your screen in two parts to run two apps at the same time (same gesture as for Slide Over but you have to go more to the far border of the screen)<br>\n- You can force rotation in all apps so that Split View does look good, even on smallest devices !’’<br>\n- You can now deactivate the gesture to make the dock appearing in apps from the settings<br>\n- An home button press dismiss the dock if presented in apps, instead of going back to the home screen<br>\nIn v1.1-1 :<br>\n<br>\n- No more safemode crashes on iPhone X, all is working properly (thanks to the beta testers :) )<br>\n- To ensure compatibility with iPhone X, Slide Over feature had to be disabled (only for this device), I’m sorry about this :/<br>\n- To make the dock appearing while in other apps on iPhone X, swipe from the top center of the screen to the bottom (left gesture for Notification Center and right one for Control Center work as before)<br>\n- The bottom center gesture to show the Control Center on devices other than the iPhone X work as normal (the scroll is continuous as stock)<br>\n- Removed a bug that caused iPad users to have suggested apps appearing whereas the corresponding option was disabled in settings<br>\n- Perfected the compatibility with Noctis and other tweaks of this kind<br>\n<br>\nSpecial thanks goes to @rob311apps for his help on getting continuous scrolling animation for control center, and to @CydiaGeek, @_Easy_Z_, @dirtdiesel for having accepted to test the update on their iPhone X :)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIn v1.1:<br>\n<br>\n- Fixed safe mode caused while having installed FloatyDock and other tweaks that modify the icons layout (such as betterFiveColumnHomescreen or ReformX)<br>\n- Fix gestures conflict on iPhone X : gesture for showing dock is limited to the left side of the screen<br>\n- It’s no more necessary to deactivate \"Access Within Apps\" in \"Control Centre\" section of the Settings app for Slide Over to be possible :) (Control Center can be activated from the center of the screen)<br>\n- Hopefully fix iPhone X crash ? (Need feedback on this as I don’t own an X)<br>"
