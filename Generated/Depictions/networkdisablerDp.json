If you don't want to disable the entire cellular network, you can turn off individual apps from the \"Cellular\" by Settings app and the networks running in the background will work.\n\nThis prevents ads from appearing in the app.\n\nI plan to add more features, so if you need a new update, please add my repository.\nhttps://cydia.ichitaso.com\n\nThe request is from /u/legacyiOS\n\nSet it to your desired setting.\n\nConfigure options from Settings app."
