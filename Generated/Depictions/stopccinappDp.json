Categories use to only block when English was set as the language. Now every language is supported. Note: Only the currently selected language is shown in the menu.<br>\n\niOS9 support\n\nOptimization.<br>\nFixed: General Bugs, mostly Preferences related.<br>\nFixed: Crash when installing on a fresh install. Devices that restored from backups were not affected.<br>\nNew: Still need to access the CC/NC in a blocked app? The Activator options \"Show Control Center\" & \"Show Notification Center\" now take precedence over StopCCinApp. Perfect for the occasional times you still need access to your switches.<br>\n\n+iOS8 support.\n\nNew: Option to hide the Notification Center\n<p>\nFixed - Applist Dependency<Br>\n7.1.1 Support<br>\n<p>\nUI Facelift.
