SwitcherCC slides it up and scales it down to add a small version of the control center on the bottom.\n\nThe control center has three pages:\n- Controls: Use your settings and quick launch toggles along with the brightness slider! (Supports Polus and FlipCC)\n- Air buttons: The buttons for airplay, airdrop, and night shift. (Supports Noctis)\n- Music: A small version of the control center music page. (Supports Masq)\n\nDevelopers can also create their own pages with our theos template. Contact me via email or twitter if you're interested.\n\nSwitcherCC also has some great customization options along with support for you favorite control center tweaks -- all for free!"
