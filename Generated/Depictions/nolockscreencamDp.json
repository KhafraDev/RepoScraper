There’s no new features for iOS 7-10.\n\n\nUpdate for iOS 11.x, also changed settings to user defaults so no resprings necessary to turn on/ off. Added a respring button for convenience though if by chance a particular jailbreak doesn’t update immediately. Also made a fix for iOS 7. Tweak is fully compatible and tested on every firmware from 7-11.4\nAdded compatibility for iOS 7, 8 and 11. Added option to remove from CC. Updated preference bundle a little as well.\n\nAdded iOS 9 compatibility, and preference bundle to turn on and off in Settings. Now compatible with iOS 9.0-10.x"
