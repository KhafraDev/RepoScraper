It also fills other sections of your Settings app. You can set boot-nonce, save APTickets (on-board as well), change device resolution etc as well. The information System Info shows is read directly from the device.\n\nAbout Section\n\n- Application list if you tap the application cell in about view\n- Tap an app in the application list to see detailed info on that app\n- Swipe on Applications cell to copy application list to clipboard\n- Make 'Model' cell copyable\n- Packages cell shows installed cydia/dpkg packages count\n- Tap on Packages cell to cycle through package sections\n- Swipe on Packages cell to copy Cydia/dpkg packages list\n- MLB Serial number\n- Rear camera serial\n- Front camera serial\n- Root partition name and capacity\n- Free memory (live cell)\n- Public IP\n- Gyroscope model\n- Accelerometer model\n- Compass model\n- Pressure sensor model\n- ECID\n- Swipe on ECID cell to save APTicket(SHSH2 file) or submit/convert your on-board APTicket(apticket.der)\n- Device identifier\n- Platform model (deviceClass/hardware platform/boardconfig)\n- Device identifier\n- Regulatory model (\"A\" number)\n- UDID\n- Boot-nonce\n- Swipe Boot-nonce cell to set boot-nonce in nvram\n- Battery capacity (in mAh)\n- Swipe battery capacity cell to show health %\n- Battery Serial\n- Battery cycle count\n- Charger current\n- Charger specifications\n- Uptime\n- CPU names and count\n- CPU temperature (average of available die temperature sensors)\n- SoC name\n- Kernel version\n- iBoot version\n- Wi-Fi module name\n- Wi-Fi firmware version\n- Tap on Wi-Fi firmware version cell to show requested Wi-Fi firmware files (useful if you wish to replace/update Wi-Fi firmware)\n- Baseband chipset\n- BBGCID\n- Scroll all the way down to find the blue text to submit some info for theiphonewiki.\nPlease do this if you have a newer device.\n\nDisplay & Brightness section\n\n- Show current display resolution\n- Show brightness in mnits and µA\n- Tap resolution cell to set resolution (won't glitch on iOS 11)\n- It will show native resolution for reference\n\nSounds section\n\n- Primary audio devices\n- Secondary audio devices\n- Show when a device is active (shows a \"*\" next to its name)\n- Show what activity the device is performing\n\nTouch ID & Passcode section\n\n- Show bio sensor serial number\n- Show sensor ID (revision)\n- Tap on a fingerprint cell to show the date added and number of times you scanned that finger\n\nBattery Section\n\n- Show battery usage graph\n- Show daemons in battery view\n- Short hold and swipe left on a cell to show detailed battery usage breakdown\n- Tap empty area of the graph to see modelling view\n- Show detailed battery info\n- Display adapter name and specs(power, voltage, current) in battery view when plugged in\n- Display tristar model, name etc.\n- Display accessory name, model number, serial number etc.\n- Identify cables uniquely using the serial number. It shows up even if power isn't connected. This can also be used to test cables\n- Check if the device is receiving power and/or refusing to charge using the cells in tristar section\n\nStorage Section\n\n- Add root partition info\n- Show partitions hierarchy\n- Show partition total capacity\n\n\nCommand line tools\n\niofbres - Handles resolution changing. \"iofbres \" to change resolution. \"iofbres r\" to reset resolution from command line, in case your device's video rendering fails at the resolution you set. These changes don't require a reboot\n\nnvnonce - set generator in nvram. \"nvnonce 0xgenerator\" to set generator and \"nvnonce\" to read generator\n\nNotes\n\nSubmitting apticket.der\n\nYou can send your onboard apticket to shsh.host by swiping on ECID cell and tapping the button. The file is then sent to shsh.host. It will convert your der file to an SHSH file and validate it. If validation is successful, it will store the der and SHSH permanently on the server. A copy of the SHSH will be sent back to your device and will be stored with your shsh2 files. These files can be retrieved from shsh.host using the same methods used to retrieve shsh2 files.\n\nSaving SHSH2\n\nYou can save SHSH2 for currently signed versions using system info. Swipe on ECID cell and tap the button to start the process. All the identifiers will be read right from the device and sent to shsh.host. You can only save 1 ticket per sessions (and that's all you need to do).\n\nTo access your shsh2 files later.\n\n- Send /myshsh to @rJailbreakBot()\n- Go to https://shsh.host//\n- Get them from /private/var/mobile/SHSH/ on your device\n\n\n\nDiscord: @ARX8x"
