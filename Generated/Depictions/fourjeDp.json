This update addresses these issues.\n\nThere is a known bug with Fourje when you try to play downloaded videos on the device, which will cause the app to freeze. This bug will be fix soon.\n\nOther than this bug, If Fourje fails to bypass Channel 4's jailbreak detection please contact me via email.\n\n\nFixed bypassing issue, when the All 4 app gets stuck on the loading screen. (Now works on iOS 7-9 on all architectures!).<br>\n<br>\nIf Fourje still doesn't work on your device, please contact me via email.\n\nAdded iOS 9 support and updated to work with latest All 4 changes"
