By default, Pasithea Keyboard replaces the Tibetan keyboard and automatically adds itself to the activated keyboards list. Pasithea Keyboard can be used to quickly insert past pasteboard history just by switching to it via the iOS \"globe\" button.\n\nPlease note that if you need to use the Tibetan keyboard, you may choose to instead replace the Tamil keyboard - you may do this from Pasithea's settings.\n\nIf you do not wish to Pasithea Keyboard at all, you may completely turn its functionality off in Pasithea's settings.\n\nThe other method of usage is Pasithea's ControlCenter toggle listener - suitable for use in either Control Center (iOS 11 module) or Flipswitch (iOS 10 Control Center / Activator).\n\nPlease install CCSupport to use ControlCenter toggle.\n\nWhen Pasithea's Flipswitch or ControlCenter toggle listener is invoked, it will show the pasteboard history in a popup.\n\nTap on the desired history entry to copy it, then tap on a text field to insert it.\n\nBy default, Pasithea will store up to 40 strings of Pasteboard history. The maximum can be changed in Pasithea's settings, ranging from 5 entries all the way to 100 entries. Pasithea will not save duplicate text strings.\n\nConfigure options from Settings app."
