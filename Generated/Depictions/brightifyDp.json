This *should* fix all of the unreadable or unusable screens in the app.\n\nDevelopment on this tweak will be critical fixes only until June 2017; I encourage anyone who wants to see new features before then to head on over to the repository and make contributions.\n\n\nv0.2.1:<br>\n* Removed donation link, as PayPal doesn't let me use donation money. Apologies to anyone who donated, that money is somewhere I can't access.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nVersion 0.2 of Brightify brings some (hacky) fixes!<br>\n<br>\nFixed in this version:<br>\n* Genre cards hard to read.<br>\n* Odd blue window glitch on Spotify device popup.<br>\n* Black flashing when switching tabs.<br>\n* Volume overlay could not be read.<br>\n* Untested iPad support.<br>"
