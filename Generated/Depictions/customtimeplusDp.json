A lot of configurable options are included.\n\nSo what exactly can you do with CustomTime+?\n\n1. Along with the clock, you can set CustomTime+ to show the date as well.\n\n2. Along with the clock, you can set CustomTime+ to show your current IP-address as well.\n\n3. Along with the clock, you can set CustomTime+ to show your device's free memory, both in MB but also in percentage.\n\n4. Write a totally custom time string with plain text.\n\n5. Combine multiple options!\n\nSee the included formatting guide in the preferences for more information :)\n\nCompared to other tweaks, this tweak will not drain battery. That's also basically something nobody wants to happen, right?\n\nFeel free to follow me on Twitter for the latest updates (@ijapija00)\n\nAlso, feel free to add my public repo (to achieve fast bug fixes, betas and the latest updates faster). Add http://cydia.ijapija00.com in Cydia."
