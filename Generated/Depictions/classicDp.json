Version 1.1 was kind of a mess, so I decided to fix that. Here are some big changes I've made:<br>\n<br>\n1. I now use different methods instead of layoutSubviews so my code isn't called over and over again. This should make this update like 50% faster on its own.<br>\n<br>\n2. Settings are now handled differently so that when Classic is disabled, none of my code runs instead of using bools in every method. This should give a speed boost when enabled or disabled. It's a win-win.<br>\n<br>\n3. Overall just fixed dumb and messy code.<br>\n<br>\nIf you're still using Classic, thank you! If you enjoy it, you can leave a donation in settings if you'd like. Thanks! :P<br>"
