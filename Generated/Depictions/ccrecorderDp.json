This might remind you of CCRecord, which however doesn't support Flipswitch. Also, with CCRecorder you'll see a small icon in the Status Bar when you're recording, so you by accident don't forget that you actually are recording the screen :)\n\nConfigure options from Setttings.\n\nNo Screenshots for this item."
