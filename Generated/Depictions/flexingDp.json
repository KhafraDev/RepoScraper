					"markdown": "Fix for iOS 13.3 for FLEX to display on the lock screen properly\n\n\n- Fix status bar gesture not working on iOS 13<br>\n- Fix possible crash<br>\nv1.0.0-2<br>\nFLEXing has been split up into two separate packages:<br>\n<br>\n- libFLEX: includes all the FLEX classes, which anyone can now provide<br>\n- FLEXing: simply loads libFLEX, and anyone can write a replacement<br>\n<br>\nThese tweaks can now be updated independently of one another, and anyone can make their own FLEX loader tweak with different features while using the most up-to-date version of FLEX. FLEXing is now at version 1.0.0, while the version of the libFLEX package reflects the version of FLEX it was built with, starting with 3.1.0.<br>\n\n- Support for arm64e / A12<br>\n- Copy object address by long-pressing on description<br>\n- Address explorer (paste an address to view object)<br>\n- Fixes logging for iOS 10+<br>\n- Adds back a gesture to activate window without status bar<br>\n- 3 finger hold anywhere<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nUpdated for iOS 12\n\nForgot to remove artificial Activator requirement from the previous version. This version does not require Activator. Long press on the status bar to open. Also:<br>\n<br>\n    - Add \"Get\" button to property/ivar editor screen<br>\n    - Fix crash surrounding SwiftObject subclasses<br>\n    \n- Fixed instance chooser returning a FLEXObjectRef and not the selected object\n- Added +[NSBundle mainBundle] to the globals list\nLong press on status bar to activate, since last update relied on a feature of RocketBootstrap that doesn't actually exist. Sorry for the inconvenience!<br>\n<br>\nIncludes other minor bug fixes.<br>\n\nUpdated to latest FLEX source:<br>\n- Fixes a handful of crashes<br>\n- Misc new features and enhancements<br>\n<br>\nOther changes:<br>\n- Drops OBJCIPC dependency (you can uninstall it if nothing else depends on it)<br>\n\niOS 10 compatability<br>\n<br>\nIf the Flex window won't appear in certain apps, please reach out to me on Twitter @ThePantsThief or email me at ThePantsThief@me.com. I may have a solution that I want kept quiet.<br>\n\nFixes a possible crash when viewing properties of an object\n\n- New icon<br>\n- Updated to latest FLEX version<br>"
