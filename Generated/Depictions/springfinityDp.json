Otherwise, Springfinity functions identically without IconSupport.\n\nKnown Issues:\nFor a short time (a couple seconds) after dropping icons, they're temporarily able to visually pass over the dock. This is due to how Apple has implemented drag-and-drop behavior, and while I'm looking into it I'm not sure it's practical to fix.\n\nSupport\nTwitter :\nEmail : nathan.whitaker01@gmail.com\nReddit :\n\nContributions are welcomed, and can go to\n\n\nCredits to chpwn/Xuzz Productions for Infiniboard, which this tweak was built off of.\n\nConfigure options from Settings."
