The device will simply reject it and use the next authentication method. Your passcode has to be entered once to re-enable biometric authentication. Upon trying to authenticate with TouchID or FaceID multiple times, the system may kick you into lockscreen to ask for passcode.\n\nConfigure Activator from Settings\n\nNo Screenshots for this item"
