					"markdown": "Note: FlixEnhancer for Netflix has been rebranded to FlixRatings for Netflix. Additionally, this package is changing repositories for new purchases. If you already have purchased FlixRatings, you can continue to use this version as it will continue to receive updates. More details can be found at.\n\nCompatible with iOS 8, 9, 10, 11,, 12 and 13 and all devices that can run Netflix 9.x.x, 10.x.x, 11.x.x, and 12.x.x.\n\nThis tweak will only work with titles that are presented in English. For best compatibility please set your Netflix profile language to English.\n\n\nFlixRatings is a tweak which presents the user with an \"enhanced rating\" from a popular online website that provides user and critic reviews for various filmography directly within the Netflix application for iOS. When available, this additional rating is seamlessly shown underneath the title of the summary page for any given movie or TV show. By tapping on the rating, Safari will navigate to the originating website which has more information about the rating. Version 2 of this tweak features a complete rewrite of the logic used for matching a title to a rating, resulting in a much higher success rate of finding the correct enhanced rating.\n\n\nThe rating is shown by either a percentage and/or meter, accompanied by an appropriate emoji. The ability to enabled or disable the rating percentage and/or meter can be configured directly within the settings inside the Netflix application.\n\nA \"star\" emoji is given out only to films (i.e. it will not be shown for TV shows). This type of emoji is given out to films which have:\n1. Maintained a steady score of 75% or higher\n2. At least 5 reviews from top critics\n3. More than 80 total reviews (for wide-release films)\n4. More than 40 total reviews (for limited-release films)\nA standard \"smile\" emoji indicates that at least 60% of the reviews are positive (also known as \"Fresh\" status).\nFinally, a \"poop\" emoji is shown when less than 60% of reviews are positive (also known as \"Rotten\" status).\n\nIf an enhanced rating cannot be found or determined for a specific title, a message will be displayed letting you know that the rating is not available. Please note that by enabling this feature, a small amount of additional data will be used.\n\n\nA legacy feature from FlixEnhancer has been retained: forward skip. At some point with the release of Netflix 10.x.x, the developers of Netflix revamped the in-app video player to include a forward skip button natively. That being said, the forward skip feature of this tweak is still functional when using the cast feature since Netflix does not yet provide a way to do that natively. Additionally, the forward skip feature of the tweak is available for older versions of the app which can be useful if you're stuck on a legacy version of iOS. Therefore, the Forward Skip feature is still included and can be configured in the settings. By enabling the forward skip option, a new button will be shown when playing a video within the native player of legacy versions of the application as well as on the casting bar of all Netflix versions. The skip time can be changed on the fly by tapping and holding on this new button, giving you the option to select between 10 and 60 seconds. The forward skip option can be toggled and configured from within the Netflix settings.\n\nDisclaimer: this tweak was designed to work with Netflix versions that are specified above in the tweak description. I will do my best to promptly test and update the tweak for any changes that Netflix makes in the future. However, if Netflix decides to completely redesign their application, I cannot guarantee that the tweak will be updated.\n\nEmoji art supplied by."
