(won't drain too much battery as it was optimized for non-OLED screens)<br>\n· Added application specific colored notifications i.e. Reddit = orange, Twitter = blue. (this feature does a color scan on the icon itself so any themed icons will be scanned for their colors, so monochrome themes won't work too well)<br>\n· Made Always-On mode more dependable. (hopefully clearing up a few conflicts with other lockscreen tweaks)<br>\n· Fixed a memory leak that would be caused if Dots was enabled with Always-On.<br>\n· Updated Dots animation to be more fluid.<br>\n\n- Added new animation: Sonar.<br>\n- Added new effects to Border: Rainbow and Pulsate.<br>\n- Added Always-On option and frequency preferences.<br>\n- Added a option for supporting me on Twitter.<br>"
