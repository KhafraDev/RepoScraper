If you are in non-jailbroken state with this option left enabled when you were jailbroken ,HomeKit may not work at all and you won't find the switch to turn it off in Settings. Make sure you disable this option if you wish to work in a non-jailbroken state, or especiallyyou remove the tweak. If you suddenly can't access your devices and you don't know why, check if you are non-jailbroken and if you forgot the switch on, while jailbroken. Just jailbreak and turn the switch off. You have been warned.\n\n\n\nNo icons or settings are added. Just the \"Home\" stock option in settings."
