Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines, though it does provide helpful libraries that can be used to build them. The name \"LLVM\" itself is not an acronym; it is the full name of the project.\n\nClang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles (e.g. about 3x faster than GCC when compiling Objective-C code in a debug configuration), extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The Clang Static Analyzer is a tool that automatically finds bugs in your code, and is a great example of the sort of tool that can be built using the Clang frontend as a library to parse C/C++ code.\n\nThe LLVM+Clang in this package fully supports the iOS 11 SDK (SDK not included). You will need ld64 (for now, until lld can replace it) and CC Tools (both provided separately).\n\nFiles install to /usr/share\n\nThis is a developer package; no new icons are added to the homescreen. Tools are accessible from the command-line or remote terminal."
