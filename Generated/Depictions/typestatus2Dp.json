This is the default setting TypeStatus will use when you haven't explicitly configured this on a contact.\n• Changes the recommended status bar support package to libstatus9 on iOS 9.1+.\n• The issue causing a freeze when opening apps inside folders with Classic Folders installed has been fixed in Classic Folders 2.\n• Updates various translations.\n\n\n• Adds support for iOS 10.<br>\n• Adds a new “sending file” notification, displayed while your device is downloading a file someone sent to you.<br>\n• Syncs TypeStatus per-person read receipt blocking settings with iOS 10’s new built in read receipt blocking feature. This includes older iOS versions – you can upgrade to iOS 10 and your TypeStatus read receipt settings will be preserved even if you don’t install TypeStatus.<br>\n• Prevents “Buddy Name” from sometimes appearing in place of the sender’s name.<br>\n• Updates various translations.<br>\n\n• Fixes an issue causing the iMessage daemon to crash when a message is read.<br>\n• Fixes an issue causing the package metadata file to be installed to the filesystem (InstaBetter conflict).<br>\n<br>\nChanges since TypeStatus 2.1.1:<br>\n• Fixes an issue causing the Remote Messages tweak’s daemon to crash.<br>\n• Fixes an issue causing read receipt blocking to not work when read receipts are disabled in the Messages settings. (Fix contributed by Stilldabomb, thanks!)<br>\n• Fixes an issue causing notifications to remain stuck in the status bar.<br>\n• Fixes an issue causing the typing notification/read receipt switches to not appear in the Messages app.<br>\n• Fixes an issue causing the Messages page of the TypeStatus settings to not work.<br>\n• Fixes an issue causing TypeStatus to not work on iOS 7 and 8.<br>\n• Fixes an issue causing weird animation glitches when switching between apps.<br>\n• Fixes issues causing crashes when a notification is displayed.<br>\n• Tweaks the Messages app switches to use much less vertical space.<br>\n• Adds support for features added in TypeStatus Plus 1.1.<br>\n• Updates various translations.<br>\n<br>\nTo use status bar icons on iOS 9.2 and 9.3, install <a href=\"https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tateu.net%2Frepo%2F&package=libmoorecon\" target=\"_new\">libmoorecon</a>.<br>\n\n• Adds support for iOS 9.2 and 9.3.<br>\n• Adds and updates various translations.<br>\n• Partly mitigates an issue causing ClassicFolders to freeze when TypeStatus is installed. The freeze will not happen until at least one TypeStatus notification has been displayed since SpringBoard started. We are still looking into this issue and will have a proper fix soon.<br>\n• <strong>Status bar icons do not yet work on iOS 9.2 and 9.3.</strong> The libstatusbar package needs to be updated by its author.<br>\n\n• Adds a new feature that allows you to enable or disable typing and read receipt notifications being sent to individual contacts.<br>\n• Adds more natural alert messages. You can change back to the traditional style in Settings.<br>\n• Ignores people that you have muted using the Do Not Disturb feature in Messages. This can be disabled in Settings.<br>\n• For users that only care about the status bar notification style (as opposed to an icon), libstatusbar can now be uninstalled without it forcing TypeStatus to also uninstall.<br>\n• Fixes an issue causing SpringBoard to crash when receiving a typing notification in some situations.<br>\n• Fixes an issue causing the icon to appear black on a white status bar.<br>\n• Fixes an issue causing a TypeStatus Plus button to appear in the Settings when TypeStatus Plus isn’t installed.<br>\n• Fixes an issue causing Remote Messages to crash when TypeStatus is installed.<br>\n• Adds some new translation languages and updates existing ones.<br>\n\n• Fixes an issue causing notifications to sometimes stick for longer than they should.<br>\n• Fixes an issue with typing notifications not showing on iOS 7/8.<br>\n• Fixes an issue causing the “Show For” setting to not update immediately.<br>\n• Fixes issues caused by libstatusbar8 (the fork by Elijah and Andrew) being preferred over libstatusbar (the official package, on BigBoss).<br>\n• Adds Swedish translations.<br>\n• Provides fixes for the Norwegian, Polish, and Finnish translations.<br>"
