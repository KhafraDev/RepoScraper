If Rubik´s developer updates it, I recomend to use Rubik instead of XB-AutoNetwork.\n\nATENTION!! ONLY 3G-4G CC TOGGLE WORKING BY NOW... 2g-3g and 2g-4g are under construction.\n\n- Disconnects data cellular when Wifi is connected to a network. Disconnect Wifi after a custom time when is disconnected from a network.\n- Delete any Known Network you want (by example airports, hotels, etc.).\n- Auto enable Wifi with custom time. If it´s not connected Wifi will be disabled.\n- Enable/disable Wifi when device becomes locked/unlocked. Wifi module is partially disabled when device is locked, but it drains battery anyway. (Credits to CydiaGeek)\n- Activate 3G-4G Control Center toggle (Provided by XB-CCModules tweak). It is supposed to switch between 2G-3G-4G connections, but only 3G-4G is working by now...\n\n\nwill be appreciated.\n\nVideo Demonstration:"
