Display a selfie of the person as the next/previous photo. Each subsequent swipe will take another photo. (These are temporary photos).\n2. Show a custom image from your photo library\n3. Prevent swiping completely (or loop if multiple photos selected)\n\nFeatures:\n- Select one or multiple photos to lock\n- TouchID or password protection\n- Video support (in single item lock)\n- Activator gestures to enable/disable\n- Show/hide lock button\n- Prevent the Photos app from being closed in the app switcher when locked\n- iPad support"
