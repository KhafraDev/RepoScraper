Before applying the image, you can also crop and rotate it so it perfectly fits your needs. You can also apply an image to all currently visible icons or to all icons in a folder, the image will be automatically sliced in smaller pieces and applied for the icon images.\n\nYou can also backup your current custom icons in the icon library and quickly restore them whenever you want. Custom icons in the icon library can be stored in multiply directories which allows you to have different setups of custom icons in an organized way.\n\nReplace the images of your app icons which you don’t like or make icon images fit your theme and personalize your device even more.\n\nAppcon does NOT require Winterboard or Anemone.\n\nWorks on all iOS devices with iOS 9.0+.\nConfigure options from Settings app"
