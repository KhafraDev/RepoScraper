After \"establishing\" a connection, a custom carrier name is shown, alongside a real fake strength indicator.\n\nIf you choose to show your WiFi connection, your device is still pretending to search for a network, but uses the WiFi connection (if available) to show the details in the status bar. If you're not connected, it says \"No Service\", just as you would expect.\n\nSignal also allows you to override the data connection type. Connected to a WiFi network? Make it show LTE instead. Not connected to anything? That lousy GPRS connection will do.\n\nOpen source"
