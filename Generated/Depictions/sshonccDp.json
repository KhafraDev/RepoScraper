A Settings menu for changing the port that OpenSSH listens on, and whether root login is allowed.\nAdd the toggle to ControlCenter from Settings > Control Center > Customize Controls.\n\nWhether the SSH server stays off or starts up after rebooting/re-jailbreaking, can be changed in the OpenSSH Settings.\n\nWhen turning sshd off, active sessions get disconnected. This functionality can be turned off in the Settings.\n\nFor the ones loving the shell, it also includes the command SSHswitch which has the same functionalities, `SSHswitch -h` describes its options. No need to log in as root for it to work.\n\nblanxd"

In the Settings.<br>\n* Long-press on the CC toggle now takes straight to the OpenSSH Settings (not from the LockScreen).<br>\n\n* Turning the SSH server on/off from the CC on the Lock Screen in the locked state is now disabled (it can be enabled in the OpenSSH Settings if needed).<br>\n* Fixed a bug that made the toggle disappear from the CC for a few users (I apologize for that, indeed).<br>\n<br>\n* Added option to OpenSSH Settings to disallow root logins.<Br>\n* Fixed icon and module label in CC Settings.<br>"
