It was built around the idea of BioProtect X which is a paid and closed-source tweak. Don't get us wrong BioProtect X is amazing however we feel that since jailbreaks are becoming open source why shouldn't tweaks. This is why we will never charge for a Tweak and will always open source them. Shield XI is an always growing tweak with lots of features still to come. Including a Guest Mode, Custom Access Messages, Lock Toggles, lock in the app switcher and more! You can find the source code of Shield XI on\n\nThis tweak is ONLY COMPATIBLE with iOS 11.x.x\n\nConfigure options from Settings."
