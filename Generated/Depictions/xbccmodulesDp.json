This is for you!\n\nXB-CCModules adds 9 new toggles that can be added (via Settings-ControlCenter-Edit) to Control Center. Then you can remove (Airdrop and Hotspot are not implemented yet) connectivity module and use them like iOS10 way.\n\nWifi, Cellular Data, Location, Bluetooth, Airplane Mode, Reduce White Point, Take Screenshot, Auto Answer calls and Respring toggles (by now...).\nAlso each toggle comes with double action (by long pressing) to open related settings page.\n\nFor 3g-4g toggle you can check XB-AutoNetwork, which also comes with some interesting options to save battery.\n\nIt uses CCSupport tweak as dependency.\nThere is something weird when installing CCSupport or Silo. Until you edit the toggles, apple stock ones seems to be gone. But only first time, once you edit them and respring everything works perfectly.\n(THIS IS NOT AN XB-CCModules BUG!!!)\n\nMore toggles on future updates!\n\nwill be appreciated.\n\n\nConfigure options from Settings."
