I get redirected to a new tab almost directly. TabBlocker will ask you if the webpage is allowed to open new tabs, or just block them! In the settings you will find:\n- White-listed domains\n- Black-listed domains\n- Black-listed Url's\n\n[Features]\n- Configurable in settings\n- Block any new tab by specifying source URL\n- Multiple URL can be split by ;\n- Will bypass any anti-adblocker script! (no website is able to block this method)\n- Configurable option to disable new tab animations\n\nTested on iOS 11 - 12\n\nMade for fun by Droom0ne. Feel free to contact me on reddit:\n/u/Droom0ne\n\nThis tweak is opensource!\n\nVideo:"
