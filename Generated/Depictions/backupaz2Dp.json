					"markdown": "In v1.5.4.1 :\n- Important bug fix : UI is no more unresponsive after Cydia Sources and Packages backup\n\n\nIn v1.5.4 :\n- You can now log into your Dropbox account while the Dropbox app is installed ! No more need to uninstall the Dropbox app the first time you want to upload your backups into the cloud ;)\n- Added new iDevices to devices recognition code\n- The UI is now locked during all the backup / restoration processes to prevent unwanted touch to stop something important !\n\n\n1.5.3 : <br>\n- Dropbox, Google Drive and Box SDK updated for better reliability and performances ! Dropbox for example is a lot faster now !<br>\n- Fix several crash when uploading to Dropbox, especially the first time<br>\n\nNew in v1.5.2 :<br>\n<br>\n- Preferences of BackupAZ 2 Reminders updated<br>\n- Buttons in the \"About\" page of BackupAZ 2 Reminder preferences are now reactive<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nNew in v1.5 :<br>\n- BackupAZ 2 Reminder tweak directly included in BackupAZ 2 ! The tweak allow you to be reminded at device unlock to do a backup on certain day of the month.<br>\nHow it work exactly ? Go to the Preferences app > BackupAZ 2 Reminder, select things you want to backup, select the days of the month on which you would like to be reminded and that's all ! <br>\nExemple : You have chosen to backup Cydia sources and packages on the 5th. When you'll unlock your device at this day, an alert will pop up asking you if you want to do the selected backup. If you choose yes, BackupAZ 2 app will be opened and will automatically launch the selected backups ;)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nNew in v1.4.1 :<br>\n<br>\n- Support for the upcoming \"BackupAZ 2 Reminder\" tweak : if you choose \"Yes\" in the reminder alert, the app will be launched and will automatically start a backup depending on what you have choose in the Settings app (see the tweaks page for instructions when it will be out)<br>\n- Storyboard (what define the user interface in Xcode) has been entirely rewritten, Xcode has bugged everything...<br>\n- postinst script modified, no more need to change the ownership of BackupAZ folder to mobile<br>\n- Code cleanup<br>\n- Fix typo, grammar (sorry, English is not my primary language)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nNew in BackupAZ 2 v1.4 :<br>\n<br>\n- iOS 10 / iPhone 7 (plus) support<br>\n- Execution time of methods greatly reduced do to change in code<br>\n- Respring is done differently (backboardd is no more killed, instead SpringBoard) => this allow respring to work on iOS 10 and this is faster on others iOS versions<br>\n- Added an About page in the side menu to be in touch with me ;)<br>\n- The BackupAZ 2 Settings (show in the Settings app) will be submitted later as a standalone tweak. This ensure compatibility when new iOS jailbreak are released as the app doesn't depend on substrate anymore !<br>\n- Progress HUD is not shown anymore if there is no backup to restore<br>\n- API that aren't used anymore have been deleted to slim the app size<br>\n- Code cleanup<br>\n\nNew in BackupAZ 2 v1.3 : <br>\n<br>\nYou have been waiting this, here it is : cloud added !<br>\nYou have the possibility to export the entire backup folder (regardless of size) to :<br>\n- Dropbox<br>\n- Box<br>\n- Google Drive <br>\nAnd the best is that you can do this with an awesome simplicity !<br>\nSimply click on the button related to the cloud provider you want. If you have not authenticated yet, the app will launch the link procedure to your account and if you are already logged in to your account, the upload will begin ! <br>\n<br>\nFix :<br>\n- uicache is now run at every package restoration to ensure that applications (the ones that have icons on homescreen) appear immediately<br>\n\nIn 1.2.5 : <br>\n- Fix issue which caused only themes to be restored, not tweaks and apps<br>\n- New main UI color : a blue more metallic, less agressive !<br>\n- New loading screen<br>\n- Various bug fix<br>\n- Code preparation for adding Dropbox, Box, and Google Drive cloud storage (next release)<br>\n<br>\n<p>\nIn 1.2.4 : <br>\n- Fix for user who have \"Stashing for iOS 9.2 - 9.3.3\" installed as of version 1.2.1 and for which the app is crashing at first launch. The fix won't be working at the first app install. To apply it, reinstall the app from Cydia and you'll be able to launch the app as normal !<br>\n\nMinor UI changes<br>\nBug fixes and code improvement<br>\n\n- Cydia packages restoration method modified. This fix few bugs caused by GPG error during source refresh that blocked BackupAZ 2 to restore your package<br>\n- Overall performance greatly improved due to better backgrounding management<br>\n- Log added during cydia packages restoration. You can find it here: /var/log/restoreCydiaPackages_log.txt. In case of any issue and if you have to contact me, please join this document<br>\n- Fix some text mistyped<br>\n\nFix crash during app opening on devices that doesn't support 3D touch<br>\n3D touch quick actions optimized: the launch time is greatly reduced !<br>\n<p>\n<p>\nNEW in 1.1 of BackupAZ:<br>\n<br>\n3D Touch support on newer iPhones (or older models with tweak like Forcy) for following actions: launch a Cydia backup (Sources and Packages), launch an all in one backup, launch directly the Restore page of BackupAZ 2 and the Option page<br>\n<br>\nMobile substrate add-on included: you can now be advertised at device unlock every 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 of each month to do a backup following the parameters set in the settings page (go to the Settings apps of your device). If you choose yes at the alert, no need to open BackupAZ 2, the backup(s) will be done directly from the SpringBoard ;)<br>\n<br>\nBackup size calculation: check the size of a backup already done, or calculate the size of a specified backup that youâ€™ll do to estimate the memory that will be taken by this one ;)<br>\n<br>\nAlong these new features: improvement and bug fixes !<br>\n<br>\nIMPORTANT NOTE: due to the add of the mobile substrate add-on, existing backup folder (/var/mobile/Library/Preferences/BackupAZ) will be renamed to BackupAZ.old. Old backup will be kept. If you need to use them, copy the .zip inside the new BackupAZ folder. Thanks for your comprehension<br>"
