With more than 100 different options, from the number and the size of icons on the homescreen, to animations, to even the most remote aspect of iOS, you will finally have full control over how your device looks and behaves.\n\n\nWe have worked really hard to deliver you the best user experience, and this is why most of the options in Springtomize 4 no longer require a respring and can be applied in real time. Moreover, for the very few options that do require a respring, Springtomize will show you a beautiful Status Bar notification.\n\n\nProfiles is a groundbreaking new feature for you to experience Springtomize in a much better way than you ever have.\n\nWith Profiles, you can maintain an unlimited amount of different configurations and switch back and forth among them.\nThis for example allows you to keep a \"Clean\" profile, with hidden icon labels and some other minimalistic options, as well as a \"Fun\" profile with dozens of cool animations, custom fonts etc.\n\nYou can add, duplicate and remove profiles with ease in its dedicated section in the Settings.\n\n\nWe have been rewriting Springtomize 4 from scratch with an eye out for iOS 10, which means that it is much faster, more energy efficient and more user friendly.\nIt is powered by a powerful settings engine which is technically superior to any other configuration management tool you may have used before.\n\n\nIf you think that there is something wrong with how Springtomize 4 works, then you will be happy to hear that we have included a Bug Reporting panel. Moreover, if you would like to see a new feature implemented in Springtomize 4, just let us know through the \"Feature Request\" panel from within Settings.\n\n\nWords can describe a lot, but they can't give you the feeling of using Springtomize and they can't make you experience the true power of Profiles, so why don't you give it a try?\n\nGet Springtomize 4 today and start customizing your device, all over again."
