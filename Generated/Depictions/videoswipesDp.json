It now also has support for YouTube and Facebook video players (also works on thumbnails). It allows to rewind/forward the video, change volume, change brightness and toggle play/pause. All of this with convenient gestures!\n\n- Swipe left/right : rewind/forward the video of 15s (you can change the number of seconds in settings)\n- Swipe up/down on the left of the screen : increase/decrease volume (configurable steps)\n- Swipe up/down on the right of the screen : increase/decrease brightness (configurable steps)\n- Swipe down on the middle of the screen : dismiss the player\n- Long press anywhere : toggle play/pause\n\nDon't forget to follow me on Twitter @AnthoPak to get live updates!\n\nFeel free to contact me via Mail or via Twitter to submit bug reports or feature requests.\n\nNote: be sure to have Cephei installed for settings to work."
