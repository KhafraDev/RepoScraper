It is completely customizable to your needs. You can use it as a unobtrusive volume hud in your status bar or like a Android like volume slider with overlay.\n\nSonus has a lot of options to configure. You can adjust the color and size of your slider and your overlay, add a gradient to it, or use it's blur background style, change the position and paddings, animation durations and styles, automatically hide the statusbar when the hud is shown, enable tap to dismiss and interaction with the slider, futher you can you can enable indicator icons that show you which volume is being adjusted - and change the color of these icons too.\n\nIt does not interfere with any custom volume huds such as YouTube, Instagram or Snapchat.\n\nConfigure options from Settings."
