Right now I have only used it on an iPhone 7 Plus so I imagine it should work on the 8 Plus but devices smaller than that is unknown. The dock does not look so good with 5 icons in it but it still works with 5 icons (see the second screenshot). The theme used on the icons in the dock is my theme \"Text-Based\".\n\nConfigure Anemone from Settings."
