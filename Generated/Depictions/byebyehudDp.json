Now ByeByeHUD will correctly display mute/loud icons and ringtone/master volume (using the hardware switch at the left side of the phone) at any time.\n\n\nVersion 1.1.2: \n- Fixed bugs in View Modes: \"Minimal View\" & \"Bar View\". Sorry for that.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 1.1: <br>\n<br>\n1) Further supported Graphical representation for mute/silent mode (when the hardware switch at the left side of the device is used). New Slider View icons will now make it easy to tell, if you just switched from loud to silent or reverse. Added \" R: \" for Ringtone before Minimal View volume representation where needed.<br>\n<br>\n2) Fixed the volume value representation when the hardware hardware switch is used to mute/unmute in all View Styles. It will now present the Ringtone Volume level, instead of Master Volume level (reported by snowgoer540 at r/jailbreak).<br>\n<br>\n3) Added an option about \"Slider View Dismiss style\", since some users did prefer fading than disappearing upwards.<br>\n<br>\nAny feedback and/or suggestion is highly appreciated.<br>\nThank you r/jailbreak community.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nVersion 1.0.3: <br>\n<br>\nAdded features requested by the r/jailbreak Community.<br>\n<br>\n1) Added higher resolution icons for the Slider View.<br>\n2) Added graphical representation for mute/vibrate mode in Slider View.<br>\n3) Made the Slider View disappear upwards, instead of fading Apple's way.<br>\n<br>\nAny feedback and/or suggestion is highly appreciated.<br>\n\n<br>\n- Made the Slider View disappear upwards instead of fading Apple's way as requested by r/jailbreak Community.<br>\n<br>\nAdded new icons to the Slider View to support the hardware switch being set to mute (As requested by r/jailbreak community).<br>"
