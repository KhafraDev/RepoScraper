Compatible with all devices (including A12).\n\nQuickPrefs is a little -yet useful- tweak that lets you quickly access tweak preferences with Force Touch on Settings app. Are you often changing settings of a specific tweak and are tired of searching it in your -so long- settings page? Or you're a tweak developer who is currently working on its tweak setting page? QuickPrefs is for you! You can add up to 8 tweak names that will be added to the stock Force Touch Settings items.\n\nSince version 1.1 you can also set custom paths like \"General/Keyboard\" that will bring you to stock preferences panes.\n\n- Add up to 8 items to Force Touch Settings.app menu\n- Choose whether you want to show items before or after stock items\n- Remove stock items to get more space for your items\n\nQuickPrefs is open source.\n\nDon't forget to follow me on Twitter @AnthoPak to get live updates!\n\nFeel free to contact me via Mail or via Twitter to submit bug reports or feature requests.\n\nNote: be sure to have Cephei installed for settings to work."
