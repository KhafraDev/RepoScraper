It is compatible with a variety of other CC Tweaks likes Noctis, Polus, FlipControlCenter, and so many more. You can reorder sections of the control center, hide some, have a multi-slider to save some space, reorder toggles if you are using Polus or FlipControlCenter, and you can do all of this with a simple second swipe up while the ControlCenter is open. It even gives you a new slider to use in the ControlCenter, one to control the audio balance between your left and right earbuds, handy for when one side breaks suddenly when you are on the road.\n\nHorseshoe is also fully compatible with iPads as well, I didn't forget about you guys :)\n\nHorseshoe has gained praise from IDB for being \"A great new UI for Control Center\" and was featured as their favorite tweak release of the week.\n\nHorseshoe also has been featured by EverythingApplePro multiple times, including is his \"iOS 100 - 100 Features Wishlist\" being front and center on the video thumbnail."
