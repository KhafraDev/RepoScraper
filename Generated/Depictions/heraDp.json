It's simple, you just have to press the logo of the wifi to be able to choose a network.\n\nDo you want to quickly access the clock application? You just press the time and a shortcut of the clock application will open (the application must be opened in the app switcher before).\n\nYou can connect to a bluetooth device by pressing the bluetooth icon.\n\nYou can activate the power low mode by pressing the battery.\n\nWhen you press the icons as not disturbing, blocking rotation, location and data, they turn off.\n\nIt does not have everything!\n\nYou have the possibility to move freely and without respring each icons of the status bar, you just need to hold an icon and move it.
