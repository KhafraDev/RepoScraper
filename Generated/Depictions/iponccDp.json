If your CC doesn't have room for a 3x1 sized module, choose the \"IP button\" (1x1 size), which you need to tap in order to see your IP addresses.\n\nI have not tested this on 5S/SE/iPads, so please report any possible issues to me (ie. I don't know what it looks like on these screen sizes).\n\nblanxd\nSource code available"
