Use an Activator action to unlock your phone, or to disable auto-unlock until next real unlock!<br>\nNOTE: Activator is not a dependency (this is done so you can use this tweak without it) therefore you have to install it on your own if you want it<br>\n• iOS 9 support<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nChanges in version 1.5:<br>\n• Bugfix: Bluetooth devices settings were lost after resprings<br>\n<br>\n• Timeouts are now maintained over resprings!<br>\n• Added option to allow enabling of auto-unlock even when Bluetooth/WiFi are connected while the device is locked<br>\n<br>\n• Added a paypal button in settings for all the kind people out there willing to support a student. If you're enjoying this tweak, please consider donating!<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nChanges in version 1.4:<br>\n• Bugfix: on iOS 10 dismiss if no notifications would dismiss anyway<br>\n• Bugfix: disable in time interval would not work properly on certain intervals<br>\n<br>\n• Added support for iOS 11.4<br>\n• Added 'hours' as a unit for timeouts<br>\n• Added option to keep the tweak disabled even after the time interval specified, until the next passcode unlock (or Touch ID/Face ID, if not disabled)<br>\n\nChanges in version 1.3:<br>\n• Bluetooth support!<br>\n• Added option to disable \"PassBy Enabled\" alert<br>\n• Added dialog to optionally attach settings when sending email feedback<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nChanges in version 1.2:<br>\n• Added option to save passcode (encrypted) over resprings<br>\n• Added option to disable during specified time interval<br>\n• Small bug fixes and refactoring<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n• Added full iOS 10 support!<br>\n• Fixed a bug which would send device to safe mode when custom digits text field contained only 1 character<br>\n• Fixed last unlock label showing last unlock attempt rather than only the last succeeded<br>\n• Added button to send feedback via email from the bottom of the settings page<br>"
