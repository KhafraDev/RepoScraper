More details can be found\n\n\nCompatible with iOS 8 to 13\n\nSleeper is a tweak designed to give you more functionality around your stock iOS alarms. The goal of Sleeper is to allow you to sleep more using the stock iOS alarms.\n\n- Change the snooze time of the alarm\n- Using a system prompt upon unlocking the device, optionally skip an alarm within a particular set time\n- Skip an alarm completely by specifying a specific date or holiday\n- Supports both standalone alarms as well as the Bedtime Alarm introduced with iOS 10\n- Compatible with iOS 8 - iOS 12\n- Compatible with iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touches\n\n\nEditing or creating a new alarm will now show a new option: Snooze Time. Entering this view will allow you specify the hours, minutes, and seconds you'd like your alarm to perform the snooze. This interface was designed to integrate seamlessly with the stock iOS Clock application.\n\n\nUse the Skip Toggle to enable or disable the ability to skip the particular alarm. Skipping an alarm can be achieved via a prompt that is displayed upon unlocking the device within a specific period of time or by specifying a particular date/holiday to skip.\n\n\nSkip Time is the threshold that is used to determine if you will be prompted to skip the given alarm. The prompt to skip an eligible alarm will show up after unlocking the device. As an example, if you have an alarm set to go off at 8:00am and your Skip Time is 30 minutes, then if you unlock the device between 7:30am and 8:00am, you will be asked if you'd like to skip that alarm. Only one prompt will be shown each time the device is unlocked; the earliest alarm that can be skipped is what will be shown. This feature can be very useful if you frequently find yourself waking up before an alarm is going to go off.\n\n\nThe Skip Dates interface allows you to pick specific dates and/or holidays in which the particular alarm will be completely skipped/silenced. Know you'll be taking a vacation or a day off from work? Add that date to your alarm so you can sleep in those days. Do you work on Thanksgiving or Christmas? Probably not, so be sure to add those holidays to your selected holidays for your alarm. This prevents you from having to remember to turn off an alarm when you don't need to wake up early.\n\n\n\n\nThis project is open source!\n\n\nSee larger screenshots below.."

					"markdown": "- Full iOS 13 / checkra1n support (both regular alarms and the bedtime alarm)\n- In the last update, the ability to skip alarms based on selecting holidays was added but only holidays in the United States were supported. This update adds the ability to skip holidays for 43 countries (huge thanks to /u/andreashenriksson for suggesting the holidays Python package)\n- When editing/configuring an alarm, a message is now displayed notifying the user the next skip dates for the given alarm\n- Fixed layout issues with right-to-left (RTL) languages\n- Fixed a rare case where some alarms were erroneously being skipped on iOS 12\n- Improved translations for some text used throughout the user interface\n- Many other small bug/performance improvements\n\n\n- Added arm64e / A12 device support.<br>\n- Fixed a bug where the skip popup would sometimes fail to display when unlocking the device with FaceID.<br>\n\n- I think it's safe to assume that a vast majority of people do not go to work on Christmas, Thanksgiving, or other national holidays (I don't, at least for some of them). That's why I've added the ability to skip alarms based on a date or holiday! Only United States holidays are included for now; help is needed to add holidays from other countries and update the necessary translations (see below for more details).<br>\n- iOS 12 support<br>\n- Minor bug fixes<br>\n\nFix issue where the skip notification pop up might not fire in some instances.\n\nUpdate to fully support iOS 11.<br>\nSkipping the \"sleep\" alarm now displays the correct name in the pop-up.<br>\n\nFix for iOS8 and iOS9 compatibility that was broken in 3.0.1. Sorry about that!<br>\n<br>\nFix for some rare crashes on iOS10 when using the Bedtime alarm.\n\nAdded support to change the snooze time and skip options for the Bedtime alarm on iOS10. Configure those preferences for this alarm in the Bedtime alarm \"Options\" menu.<br>\nComplete code rewrite for enhanced efficiency.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSupport for iOS10 (note: support for the \"Bedtime\" mode alarm will be coming in a future update).<Br>\nFixed an issue where alarms that were created prior to installing Sleeper might display incorrect preferences.<br>\n\nAdded localization support for the final required languages. Sleeper now supports 30 different languages.\n\n- Fix for right-to-left languages displaying incorrectly on iOS9.\n<p>\n- Added iOS9 support.<br>\n- Includes localization support for many more languages (thanks translators!).<br>\n- I still need updated translations for Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, and Turkish. If you would like to help out, please send me an email.<br>\n\n- 2.0.1<br>\n- Emergency bug fix for preferences not being saved when navigating between picking Snooze/Skip times.<br>\n<p>\nv2.0.0<br>\n- Added the ability to \"skip\" an alarm before it will fire. This works by setting a \"skip time\" which is defined as the time before an alarm is set to go off. If you have skip enabled and you unlock your phone within the skip time, you will be presented with a pop up alert asking if you'd like to skip the upcoming alarm.<br>\n- Localization has been updated for various languages (thank you, translators!). However, I still need updates for many languages. Please contact me if you'd like to translate Sleeper in your language!<br>\n- Various bug fixes and enhancements.<br>\n\nLocalization support for 27 different languages.<br>\n<br>\nIf your language was not included in this update and you would like to help out, please send me an email."
