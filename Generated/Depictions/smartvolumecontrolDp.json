Those options will and should not conflict with the same options in other tweaks.<br>\n<br>\n3) Added the ability to choose where the Volume Adjustment Window will appear in Smart Minimal View (left/right), as requested by Berny Calderon.<br>\n<br>\n4) Added 4 more Activator Actions & replaced the 4 old ones for Smart Minimal View, to correspond to the new feature of choosing where the Volume Adjustment Window should present. There are now 4 Smart Minimal View Activator Actions with Adjustment Window at left and 4 more with it at the right side (8 total).<br>\n<br>\n* Since there are now 17(!) Activator Actions, I grouped them to make it easier for the users realise what they need and also make it easier and faster to find their Action.<br>\n<br>\n5) Added \"Choose Background Mode\" List Cell for \"Smart Minimal View\" and \"Smart Slider\".

For better results please use \"100 steps\" setting. Will make it even more accurate.<br>\n<br>\n--- More to come soon... ----<br>\n<br>\nAny kind of feedback and/or suggestion is highly appreciated.<br>\nPlease do mail me at: midkin@hotmail.com or dm me at twitter: @midkin. Am happy to receive feedback and/or requests.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n1) Added new position \"Horizontal Under StatusBar\" for \"Smart Slider\" and also including Avtivator action for this (per @nikosgnr request).<br>\n<br>\n2) Added the ability to change Font Style for \"Smart Minimal View\" (per @nikosgnr request).<br>\n<br>\n3) Darker the background color of \"Nougat-Like Slider\" view for increased contrast (should look even more cool).<br>\n<br>\n4) Upgraded icon graphics used for \"Nougat-Like Slider\" and \"Smart Slider\" views. New ones are much higher resolution!<br>\n<br>\n5) Supported Graphical representation for mute/silent more (when the hardware switch at the left side of the device is used). New icons will now make it easy to tell if you just switched from loud to silent or reverse.<br>\n<br>\n6) Fixed the volume representation when the hardware hardware switch is used to mute/unmute. It will now present the Ringtone Volume level, instead of Master Volume level. (reported by snowgoer540 at r/jailbreak)<br>\n<br>\n7) Fixed a situation where \"Nougat-Like Slider\" view would glitch if, users would change between home-screen -> apps, or apps -> home-screen etc, a moment before the animation finishes.<br>\n<br>\n8) Fixed a situation where, when a user had \"Change with Buttons\" switch, in device's Sound Settings, on, Ringtone Volume Slider presented at \"Nougat-Like Slider\" 's Volume Mixer would fail to update it's value.<br>\n<br>\n9) Fixed a situation where, when switching between \"Smart Minimal View\" (using Activator action) and any other View style, would cause \"Smart Minimal View\" adjustment window to not immediately disappear, waiting for switched View style to disappear. Now the adjustment window should only be visible if \"Smart Minima View\" is visible.<br>\n<br>\n10) General performance improvements and code optimisations will make the speedy switching between View styles/modes using different Activator actions even smoother.<br>\n<br>\n----- More to come soon... -----<br>\n<br>\nAny kind of feedback and/or suggestion is highly appreciated.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWorked hard, but managed to satisfy ALL requests!<br>\n<br>\n1) The new \"Nougat-Like View\" will now disappear moving upwards matching Android's native feature, instead of disappearing by Apple's native way.<br>\n<br>\n2) Added graphical representation to support mute switch for \"Nougat-Like View\" and \"Smart Slider View\" . Yeah! Now it's easy to tell if you are on vibration/mute mode or not.<br>\n<br>\n3) Made \"Nougat-Like View\" arrow button smarter! Now when you press the arrow to reveal the Volume Mixer, the arrow will now go upwards, meaning if you press it again, it will hide the Volume Mixer.<br>\n<br>\n4) When expanding \"Nougat-Like View\", Master Volume (mention as Video/Audio Volume while Volume Mixer is visible) will also have a Label showing the percentage of volume to follow the logic of the Volume Mixer.<br>\n<br>\n5) Added an option for \"Nougat-Like View\" to always show a Label with percentage of Master Volume (meaning not having to expand to Volume Mixer).<br>\n<br>\n6) You can now change both Font color and Background Color at the Smart Minimal View. You may also set the background color to be transparent (using an on/off switch), and remove the stock blur of the background to make background colors cleaner.<br>\n<br>\n7) You will now be able to change the Volume Line color of the \"Smart Slider View\" which combined with the color changes in the background will give the Slider a unique look!<br>\n<br>\n8) Fixed \"Smart Minimal View\" adjustment window that would sometimes fail to hide itself.<br>\n<br>\n9) Fixed a situation where a main hidden window would present if you changed too fast between View Styles using Activator Actions.<br>\n<br>\n10) Fixed a situation where when pressing volume up/down buttons would present the last View Style/Mode instead of presenting the one chosen from the settings panel!<br>\n<br>\n--- More to come soon... ----<br>\nComing next: New View Style that will always show 2 bars or sliders (one for Master Volume and one for Ringtone Volume), requested by Kaan (@kaanaabi).<br>\n<br>\nAny kind of feedback/suggestion is highly appreciated.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n- Enlarged the \"Nougat-Like Slider\" arrow touch area. Now the arrow button that reveals the Volume Mixer should be much easier to touch.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBIG update!<br>\n<br>\n1) Added whole new View Style. The new View is called: \"Nougat-Like Slider\" since it's an effort to mimic Android's Nougat Volume Bar.<br>\n<br>\n2) A typical but cool Volume Mixer(!) is now incorporated at the tweak for the \"Nougat-Like Slider\". Just press the arrow to make it visible (per David Potter request).<br>\n<br>\n3) Added a new Activator action (12 at total) to support the new \"Nougat-Like Slider\" view!<br>\n<br>\n4) Re-wrote Activator actions headers since there was a confusion for some users with the headers not being specific enough while watching them at the \"Assignments\" tab of Activator. Also shortened Activator actions descriptions to support low-screen models not being able to present the full text (thanks David Potter for reporting this).<br>\n<br>\n----- More to come soon... -----<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n1) Added \"More Activation Methods\" tab to the tweak's Settings Panel. Now if you plan to use Activator, you don't have to leave the tweak's Settings Panel.<br>\n<br>\n2) Activator support is kind of epic now!!! Replaced the Activator Action with 11 new Activator Actions. Now using R.Petrich's Activator tweak, gives you endless possibilities! You could for example use \"Swipe Status Bar Left\" action to present the Smart Bar at vertical left position, \"Swipe Status Bar Right\" action to present the Smart Bar at vertical right position and \"Double Tap Status Bar\" action to present the Smart Minimal View at the Center Of the Screen. You can now change the type and the position of the HUD on the fly without having to visit the settings (Thanks Berny Calderon for the suggestion). Check the new video (2:45 - 3:50).<br>\n<br>\n3) Fixed a conflict with Volume Mixer that would sometimes cause Smart Minimal View's volume adjustment window to fail autodismiss/autohide itself (Thanks David Potter for reporting this).<br>\n<br>\n4) Fixed a conflict with Noctis10 that would cause a hidden window behind the Smart Bar to become visible.<br>\n<br>\nPlease check the updated video and pictures!<br>\n<br>\nAny feedback and/or suggestion is highly appreciated!<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n1) Improved bar switch grip/touch. It should now be easier to catch. (per Oren Ifergan request)<br>\n<br>\n2) Added new Smart Bar Position: \"Vertical Right\", to support one hand volume setting for most right-handed people. (Thanks Oren Ifergan for the suggestion)<br>\n<br>\n3) Added new (third) View: \"Smart Slider\" with three positions options: \"Horizontal\", \"Vertical Left\", \"Vertical Right\". You may choose between background colors, transparent background color and extra blur for the background.<br>\n<br>\n4) Just like the \"Smart Minimal View\" and the \"Smart Bar\", \"Smart Slider\" is also smart and touchable and support activation events.<br>\n<br>\n----- More to come soon... ----<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n1) Added iOS 10 Compatibility.<br>\n2) Redesigned the graphics for both Smart Bar and the label view (now mentioned as smart minimal view).<br>\n3) Added to new switches to the smart bar. You can change from the settings panel.<br>\n4) Added the ability to choose the time before the HUD disappears (HUD auto dismiss delay).<br>\n5) Added activation method (for presenting the HUD) if you swipe to status bar (no need to press ANY keys now). Option to enable/disable the activation method in settings panel.<br>\n6) Added Activator compatibility. Stock method is ok, but Activator takes this to another level!<br>\n7) Made the label mode MUCH smarter. If you present the label (now known as smart minimal view) using an activation method, a window appears (or not! if you hide in the settings panel). While swiping to this window the volume level changes.<br>\n8) Added option to change the volume sensitivity (preciseness) adjustment while swiping the window in label mode.<br>\n<br>\n---- More to come soon... ----<br>"
