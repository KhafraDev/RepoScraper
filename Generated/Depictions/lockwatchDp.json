On devices that do not feature 3D Touch, you can long press to enter selection mode. To leave selection mode, either tap on a Watch Face or press the home button.\n\nIncluded Watch Faces:\n• Activity Analog\n• Activity Digital\n• Numerals (Regular and Rounded style only)\n• Utility\n• Simple\n• Color\n• Chronograph\n• X-Large\n\nA Weather Face is also planned. Most of the Watch Faces can also be colored in one of the 40 colors supported in watchOS 4.\n\nSpecial Thanks to Anthony Bouchard for his greatmotivating me to work on LockWatch again!\n\nThe source code is available\n\n\nSee larger Screenshots below.."
