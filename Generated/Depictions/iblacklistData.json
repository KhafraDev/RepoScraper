					"markdown": "Minor bug fixes.\n\n\nREAD THIS CAREFULLY!!!\n\nFirst, if you are NOT in iOS 11 and have iBlacklist already installed, you really don't need this update. There is nothing new for you. \n\nThis version brings support for iOS 11\n\nWARNING: This version IN IOS 11 changes the way you open the app if you set the password protection to hide the icon. Now you will open iBlacklist by accessing Spotlight and typing your REAL password in the search field available on top screen.\n\nKnown Bugs: NO ACTION not working, so i changed it to voicemail instead. In other words, NO ACTION will disconnect the call to your voicemail if you are in IOS 11 until i find a fix for it.\n\n\n* iOS 10 crash fix for Accept and Hangup a call<br>\n* iOS 10 crash fix for Add from Recent Messages option<br>\n* Minor text and appearance changes<br>\n* STATUSBAR ICONS: You won't have them unless libstatusbar (not mine) is updated to iOS10. An alternative fix is install libmoorecon (google it).<br>\n<br>\n* iOS 10.X support\n* iOS 9.3.3 compatibility<br>\n* Bug fix for password protection problem<br>\n* About status bar icons: At this moment, the latest version of libstatusbar package is 0.9.9.0-1 and this version is NOT 9.3.3 compatible. Once the developer of it update <br>\n\nFixes crash that leads to missed calls with no alert nor ringtone.\n<p>\nBug fix for camo icon not changing in 6+ and 6S+ devices <br>\nBug fix for Spotlight still bypassing iBlacklist password protection<br>\n<p>\nBug fix for messages app not sending/receiving texts that was introduced by version 9.0-1\n<p>\nFixes all the bugs the 9.0 version introduced to iOS8 users. If you are on iOS8 you can update it now. This version makes it work exactly like the 8.3 version<br>\n<br>\niOS9 fixes (a bunch of them):<br>\nBug fix for messages app problems<br>\nBug fix for spurious app opening when the icon is hidden<br>\nBug fix for spotlight bypassing password protection when launching iBlacklist from it<br>\nBug fix for Accept and Hangup option lock screen problem<br>\nBug fix for FaceTime (audio and video) leaving multiple records in our history for the same blocked call, as well as it sporadically leaving records in call history and bulletin on lock screen<br>\nBug fix for blocked call records sometimes staying in recents view<br>\nBug fix for crashing app on device registration successful<br>\n\n<br>\nThis package brings iOS9 compatibility.<br>\n<br>\nNow it waits a few seconds to open iBlacklist when you use the Hide Icon option and you type your password in the Mobile Phone app dialer.<br>\n<br>\nNow it reboots (it's required) your phone if you change the app name in Camo.<br>\n<br>\nEverything else is the same as iBlacklist 8.3 and below<br>\n<br>\nKnown Issues:<br>\n<br>\niBlacklist icon badge in Extras is NOT working yet on iOS9<br>\n\nBrings adjustments for iOS 8.3<br>\nFix no ringtone/vibration bug in iOS 8.3<br>\n6 and 6+ full resolution support<br>\n\n* Bug fix for random crashes in messages app<br>\n* Bug fix for crashes when continuity calls reach the device (iPod, iPad and iPhones)<br>\n* Continuity calls are now filtered based on your rules<br>\n* Dutch and Hebrew language files added<br>\n* Other minor improvements<br>\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE<br>\nSQL AUTH warning was being showed by iBlacklist in order to warn the user the steps to be done to load iBlacklist correctly after a hardware reboot. This warning was now changed to iBL Warning in this version, but there is still the need to first unlock your phone after every reboot if you have it passcode protected. <br>\n<br>\nBug fix for crash on call history deletion<br>\nBug fix for FaceTime block crash on 64 bit devices in iOS8<br>\nBug fix for call history deletion even with filters disabled<br>\nBug fix for the Add from recent calls not working in iOS8<br>\nNow it can play your blocked voice messages<br>\n\nFix for outgoing call to blocked numbers being terminated<br>\nFix for crashes on outgoing calls to blocked numbers<br>\nFix for fake password not opening another app<br>\n<br>\nIMPORTANT<br>\nIt seems when you have your phone passcode protected and you reboot it, all SQL database operations are NOT ALLOWED until you unlock your device with your passcode. As a result, iBlacklist can't access it's own database on device boot. It detects this condition now and warns you how to fix it until the next reboot. Tap FIX IT and unlock your device. It will restring automatically and fix this until the next reboot.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nLots of bug fixes for iOS 8 related problems<br>\nImproved operation in iOS 8<br>\n<p>\n<p>\nCompatibility update for iOS 8.

Still NO iMESSAGES support\n<li>The icons in statusbar depends on libstatusbar package. Since this package is not iOS5 ready, and i don´t know if it will, there´s no support for icons if libstatusbar package is not installed. The dependency was removed to avoid springboard crashes after installing iBlacklist. Manually install libstatusbar when it´s iOS5 ready.\n<li>Since tons of people were confused about the fake password \nprotection, now the app will have a RED navigation bar when you open it using the fake password to alert your changes will never take effect\n<li>Dual layered message filter to enforce the feature even when any message app is opened on your device screen\n<li>Bug fix for messages loss that happened while the user were navigating through the app, locking the database and avoiding making it ready to save the just arrived message\n<li>Minor bug fixes\n</ul>\n<ul>v 4.3-1\n<li>Fix for customer license verficiation\n</ul>\n<ul>v 4.3\n<li>New great feature.

Just this for now. It will also install libstatusbar for statusbar icons support.

For calls, it will search for the wildcard string starting only from the beginning on the callerID. For messages, it will search for the wildcard string that may start in the position 0 to 4 on the callerID, since messages always come with country code in front of it's callerID\n<li>IMPORTANT: New option to download your license. If you paid for a license to your current device and informed the device's register key correctly to us while doing the purchase, you can instantly download your license from the app itself. Since our e mails are considered spam oftenly, this option will help you to activate the app.\n<li>New option to move contacts between your lists\n<li>Bug fix for password challenge when the app is launched using AppSwitcher in 4.X firmwares\n<li>Bug fix for password challenge when you launch the app using the Searcher in SpringBoard (Stuck keyboard problem)\n<li>iBlacklist closes automatically when you lock the device, improving your security if you forget to close the app\n<li>Bug fix for the Auto Reply SMS being sent when you use the Accept option and actually answer the blacklisted call\n<li>\nAdded the dependency for libstausbar package for 4.X firmwares.
