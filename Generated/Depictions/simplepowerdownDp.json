No system files are modified and so any problems can easily be solved by removing the tweak in Substrate Safe Mode or No Substrate mode.\n\nAny requests or bug reports can be sent to: simplepowerdown@multichip.london\n\nEnjoy the tweak!\n\nConfigure options from Settings.\n\n\nSee larger Screenshots below.."
