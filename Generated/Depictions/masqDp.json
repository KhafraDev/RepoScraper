Everything has been rewritten from the ground up with the idea of touching as little as possible to ensure we only do a little, but still bring big results.<br> \n<br>\nDid I say big? Choose between a bigger album art (and themes) when checking out your media page, and that old tiny stock look so you can admire all that empty audio picker space! <br>\n<br>\nWanna live big all the time? Choose the new Revolutionized view (compatible with Horseshoe!) so you can see all your Masq themes in greater detail, no more squinting!<br>\n<br>\nRetirement of old 10.2 only CC blurs for new Album Art background styles that work across all devices on iOS 10 firmwares, because nobody should have to miss out !<br>\nMore unique & outstanding than before, it's a change I'm sure many will appreciate aesthetically & performance wise<br>\n<br>\nDynamic Theme Support for Lockscreen: Now you have the power to give your themes a spinning animation (spinning cd where?), designated by an emoji at the front of it's name.<br>\n* Dynamic themes are places at the bottom of the theme picker list, and will not appear in the Control Center picker.<br>\n<br>\nCleaned appearance of the Revolution compact view when no music is playing (Big issue for users of Horseshoe)<br>\n<br>\nCC compact view now sizes based on how many media buttons you have available (perfect for Apace) <br>\n<br>\nLogical Control Center presentation does it's best (and I like to think it does it well) to show you exactly what page you want when you swipe up. Why think for yourself when 60%* of the time it works every time? *results may astound you<br>\n<br>\nUpdated Social icon to use the stock iOS icon, because a system on iOS should feel like Apple.<br>\n<br>\nFixed minor issues related to the media buttons<br>\n<br>\nCompatibility improvements/fixes for many tweaks, basically anything that exists in the Control Center or Lock Screen should show it's best self when used with Masq<br>\n<br>\nHide media elements on Lockscreen, because why use a volume slider when theres two buttons right on the side of the device!<br>\n<br>\nA greater range for positioning your media views on Lockscreen<br>\n<br>\nOptimized performance tweak-wide! I care extremely about keeping Masq's as snappy as iOS should be, and am happy to say you should see performance improvements in all cases after the work I have put in\n\nMasq 1.0 -> 1.1<br>\n<br>\nChanges Made:<br>\n<br>\n-Five new themes included from Masq's big brother CustomCover! Be sure to tell @friggog how much you appreciate his designs / willingness to work with me :) Find Vinyl, Ripped, CD Case, Insert, and Clean inside this update!<br>\n<br>\n-Theme picker now displays a bit of credit ! Thanks so much to all the amazing designers who are helping me expand Masq's theme library, you all deserved a little spot to plug yourself / your inspiration! Adding a Credit.txt file to any theme allows you to display a message to Masq users in the theme-picker.<br>\n<br>\n- Updated preferences to be simpler at a glance (You may need to reselect some settings after updating)<br>\n<br>\n-Included Onion compatibility (make sure to grab 0.0.4)<br>\n<br>\n-Improved CC page presentation, now extremely smart! Optional AMP allows you to always be presented the music page when listening<br>\n<br>\n-Toggle now playing blur styles on/off in LS & CC<br>\n<br>\n-Slideshow on how to make a theme!<br>\n<br>\n-A ton of optimizations & fixes all across the board!<br>\n<br>\nThank you everyone for an excellent launch, see you soon with more exciting features / improvements!<br>"
