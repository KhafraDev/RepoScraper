Enable/Disable Switch\n2. Noctis Toggle\n3. Readable Text (For when used without Eclipse)\n4. High Contrast for Readable Text\n5. Gradient Removal Option\n6. Image Radius Setting\n7. Togglefor hiding Arlbum/Artist name\n\nPlease note that Erebus may not be compatible on versions 10.0-10.0.1 depending on your configuration.\n\nIf you have any questions, follow me on Twitter @clichewow or my Reddit /u/nathanaccidentally. Screenshots one and two and three taken with Eclipse and ColorFlow 3 installed.\n\nConfigure options in settings."

This update includes:<br>\n<br>\n1. Settings toggle for removing Album/Artist name from Now Playing screen.<br>\n<br>\n2. Added white status bar if enabled (thanks to AppleBetas).<br>\n<br>\n3. Removed table separators (hopefully).<br>\n<br>\n4. Finalized ColorFlow 3 support in now playing bar. Full ColorFlow support coming very soon, however I need to manually implement it myself.<br>\n<br>\n4. Switches use of the ColorFlow API to give more accurate colors.<br>\n<br>\n5. Added Twitter button in settings.<br>\n<br>\n6. Cleaned up some of my code to make Erebus a tiny bit more efficient.<br>\n<br>\nAgain, thank you so much for using Erebus! <br>"
