(works on any other device that has a modern status bar enabled, see below)\n\n* iOS 12 and Arm64e/A12 device support.\n* Very light-weight tweak (uses already built-in code).\n* It enables the percentage inside the icon in springboard, lock screen and in all apps.\n* The battery's icon will turn green when charging and orange when LPM is on.\n* hides the inline charging indicator.\n* hides the stock percentage in the control center.\n* Optimized to work for white and dark backgrounds.\n\nThis is a separate package because I lost the source code for the original one and I had to build it from scratch.\n\nDonations are highly appreciated :)\n\nRequires a modern statusbar (such as the iPhone X and the iPad statusbar, for older devices use it with a tweak like StatusBarXS from my repo: https://dpkg9510.github.io/\n\n\nThere are no options to configure.\n\n\nSee larger Screenshots below.."
