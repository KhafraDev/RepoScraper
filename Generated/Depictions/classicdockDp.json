Configuration options in Anemone\n\n\nSupport iPhone 6+ (Modern Mode Only).<br>\n<br>\nClassic Mode on the iPhone 6+ is supported /ONLY/ with 3rd party themes.<br>\n<br>\nAll functionality works as usual on iPhone 6 and lower.<br>\n\nFix issue where Blurred Reflections was missing from settings panel.\n<p>\n1. Support for iOS 8!<br>\n2. Support for iPhone 6.<br>\n<br>\nNote: iPhone 6+ support will be available shortly, sit tight!<Br>\n\n1. Add Option for blurred reflections\n\nAdd support for upcoming libghost library\n\nLooks like I finally put an end to the reflection bug on 7.1.x.\n<p>\nAllow winterboard themes to apply an overlay on top of the modern dock (ModernDockOverlay.png & ModernDockOverlay-Landscape.png).<br>\n<br>\nWinterboard themers: If you have any more requests for ClassicDock, I'm listening :)<br>\n<p>\nAdd iPad support to Modern mode.\n<p>\n<p>\n1. Finally version 1.0! (Notice how the version numbers before were less than 1 :P)<br>\n2. Add \"Modern\" mode for those of you who want a blurred dock with the iOS 6 shape instead of the iOS 6 dock image. Configure in settings.<br>\n3. Make icon bouncing more realistic (thank you Reed Weichler)<br>\n4. Extended the reflection again all the way to the bottom (some people didn't like this?)<br>\n5. Attempted to fix the reflection bug in 7.1.x (I don't get it anymore, but not sure about others)<br>\n6. As always, ClassicDock fully supports WinterBoard, including the new Modern Dock feature.<br>\n\n1. Add full support for iOS 7.1.x<br>\n2. Added \"Bounce Icon on Launch\" option due to many requests for it (disabled by default, enable in settings if you want it).<Br>\n\n1. Adds Full Support for the iPhone 4\n\nClassicDock themers update!<br>\n1. Support for theming indicator lights via WinterBoard<br>\n2. Support for theming the background overlay via WinterBoard<br>\n3. Add a toggle for the background overlay due to the excessive number of complaints about it<br>\n<p>\nMany exciting changes have been added to this ClassicDock update!<br>\nThe Bug Fixes:<br>\n1. InfiniDock compatibility<br>\n2. Safari Addressbar Fix<br>\n3. iPad Multitasking Gestures Compatibility<br>\nNew Features:<br>\n1. Actual, live icon reflections just like how they were done on iOS 6! Fast and fluid!<br>\n2. Killswitches in Settings (Respring to Apply)<br>\n3. Running indicators in the dock under running apps<br>\n<br>\n\n1. Reflection is now faster<br>\n2. The reflection is only updated when needed for better battery life\n3. Moar 64 Bit Fixes!<br>\n4. Seems to work on some iPhone 4's but doesn't seem to work on others. I'm trying to debug this ATM (might be iPhone4Parallax's blur option fixing it, but can't tell).<Br>\n5. Does anyone read these?<br>\n<p>\n<p>\nThe dock now reflects in realtime :) Who needs a blurred dock when you can have a reflecting dock?<br>\nAdds support for resizing the reflection using Winterboard<br>\n<p>\n<p>\nAdds iPad Support\n<p>\nDoes not work on iPhone 4 or iOS 7.1. iPhone 4 support will be added soon."
