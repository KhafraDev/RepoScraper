When the device is plugged in and charges to the set restart percentage it undoes all changes and resprings, allowing it to wake up.\n\nThe device will be completely unusable while enabled, in the case that you want to override SafeShutdown and use the remaining battery, there is the option to enable the emergency wake up feature in settings.\n\nWhat happens when the \"fake shutdown\" enables?\nThe screen is turned off and disabled, low power mode enabled, all buttons and touches are ignored, raise to wake, notifications, alarms and timers are blocked, torch is turned off, screen recording is stopped and saved, all apps are quit but not removed from the app switcher, all sounds and vibrations are disabled and more."
