The tweak may damage your battery, use it at your own risk.\nSoftware developer declines the responsibility for any damage, caused by using this tweak\n\nStandard usage scenario is like: you charge your iPhone to 75%, go outside (-10 deg. Celsius) and after 5-15 minutes the phone shows 1% and shuts off. Then you go into a warm room and your phone is like: Oh i'm okay there is still 70%. So that's the reason to have an option to block such behavior\n\nNo options to configure."
