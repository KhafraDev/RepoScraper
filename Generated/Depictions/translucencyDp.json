The results are beautiful, adding that missing touch you've been looking for.\n\nIn the future, I aim to make this a system-wide tweak. Updates will come regularly.\n\nTips:\n\n- Wallpapers with lots of vibrant colors work extremely well.\n\n- Dark wallpapers aren't an issue, as the background is translucent; the standard background is partially transparent, so the text remains readable.\n\n- The install log's translucency is broken on iPad, due to rendering /above/ the rest of the app, layer-wise. I'm trying my best, but this may not be fix-able.\n\nConfigure options from Settings.\n\nNone of the options are enabled by default. This is to prevent lag on older devices."
