It doesn´t use libHide dependency, and icons will be hidded without respring (by now, in order to show them up again, a respring is needed).\n\nWhen it´s enabled, you just need to enter edit mode (reorder or uninstall apps) and tap those icons you want to hide.\n\nTo unhide them just go to XB-Hide settings.\n\nYou can remove them from Settings User apps section too.\n\nwill be appreciated.\n\nVideo Demonstration:"
