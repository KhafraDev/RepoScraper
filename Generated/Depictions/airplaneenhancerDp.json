By the way, AE+ should be updated by the time Cydia purcheses are approved on iOS 10.<br>\n\nSorry, I messed up version 1.0.3, trying to add in some features from our Pro Package AE+ Airplane Enhancer+\nAE v1.0.4 has been reverted back into the battery saving technique that requires Activator to schedule AE on and off durations. You are still able to quickly de-activate Airplane Mode by opening any Apple app!\n<p>\n<p>\nTidied up scheduling, removed un-needed time allowances.<br>\nOptimised for iOS 9.3.3<br>\n\nTesting compatibility with iOS 7&8 (if you would like to test compatibility with either iOS7 or 8, please email RJTweaks@outlook.com)<br><br>\n<p>\nRe-released, STILL FREE TO ALL USERS!<br>\n<br>\nPlease check out our <a href=\"http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.rjtweaks.airplaneenhancerplus/\" target=\"_new\">PRO version</a> with more settings, schedules & profiles \"Stand Alone\" via the tweak's settings.<br>\n<br>"
