This removes all the limits and negative shifting is supported as well. Example: if previously time 23:59 + 1 minute would give passcode 2360 now it'll give 0000<br>\n<br>\n- Added \"Reset Settings\" option which will set up the tweak as new in case something is corruped, maybe caused by the first versions released on my private repo, or in case the user wants to reset it.<br>"
