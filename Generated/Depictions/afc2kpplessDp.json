However, due to security concerns, modern \"jailbreaks\" now avoid installing AFC2 by default.\n\nPlease understand that AFC2 is considered by many to be a security hole: you might not want to provide full USB filesystem access.\n\nSome AFC2 setups, in particular many that were installed by default with older jailbreaks (such as evasi0n for iOS 6) set a flag that allows this access to not require a \"trusted\" USB connection :/.\n\nInstalling this package will correct that mistake, and is thereby more secure than the \"stock\" from-jailbreak AFC2 configuration you may be using now.\n\nSource code available\n\nNo Screenshots for this item."
