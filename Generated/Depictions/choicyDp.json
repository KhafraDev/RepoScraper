Unc0ver will receive a fix for this in the future too.<Br>\n<br>\n<br>\n• Add an option for global tweak configuration (with options for process specific backlists/whitelists to overwrite the global one)<br>\n• Daemons that no tweak injects into are automatically hidden now<br>\n• 'Recommeded Daemons' are determined at runtime now by checking if they link against • UIKit (previously this used to be a hardcoded list of daemons)<br>\n• Process specific tweak lists should now be 100% correct (uses a mach-o / dyldSharedCache parser internally)<br>\n• Add a section for hidden applications at the bottom of the application list<br>\n• Allow the Settings app to be configured (previously it was hidden)<br>"
