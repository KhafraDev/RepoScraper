					"markdown": "Compatible with iOS 10 and 11\n\nKeyboardCall is a more musical rewrite for the keypad sound system in the phone app. Normal button press sounds are replaced with the C Major scale, with 1 being C, 2 D and so on. Swiping to the right of a key will play the next semitone up from the main note (right on 1 would be C#) while swiping left plays a semitone down. Swiping up or down and holding will sustain a note until you let go. These features go together to allow you to play almost every song you can think of! For 3D Touch-enabled devices, force touching the 8 key will enter 'music mode', in which no numbers are entered. To exit this mode, force touch the same key until it returns to normal colour.\n\nNo options to configure.\n\nNo Screenshots for this item."
