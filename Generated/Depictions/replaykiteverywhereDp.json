					"markdown": "fix some problem caused by touch indicator\n\n<br>\nCompatible with iOS 12\nv1.6<br>\n- Touch indicator with fade out animation<br>\n- Fixed auto save not working on iOS 10<br>\n- Fixed compatibility with some games/apps<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nv1.5<br>\n- Added new touch indicator feature, defaults as showing during record. Can be set to hidden or always show even not recording (Only inside an app)<br>\n- Added a fix for continuous \"Failed to start record\" error<br>\n\nv1.4<br>\n- Added option to skip permission granting<br>\n- Added option to automatic save to camera roll after finish<br>\n- Dynamic update Activator listener name<br>\n- Moved init method to reduce blames<br>\n<br>\n- 添加选项跳过权限确认<br>\n- 添加选项自动保存至相册<br>\n- 动态更新Activator动作名<br>\n- 改进插件初始化<br>\nv1.3<br>\n- Added global microphone enable control for tweak, for those who never record microphone (like me)<br>\n- Added temporary files size info, and a quick link to check'em in iFile. Also corrected my misunderstand in explaination field<br>\n- Should be more reliable now<br>\n\nv1.2 Quality update! <br>\n1. We have a setting page now<br>\n2. With that setting page, we can now control the record quality, up to 15mbps video. Find detail in the settings! <br>\n3. Speaking of quality, I've fixed the issue which ReplayKit is putting two copy of left channel into semi-stereo output. Now record with true stereo music! (Hey Apple! Why would you do this to us)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n1. Thrown away libobjcipc, now compatible with iOS 10<br>\n2. Added Chinese localization. (If you'd like to contribute for more language, please fork and fire a pull request on github, any improvement is welcomed!)<br>\n3. Added banner notification for record start and failure<br>\n4. Improved code for more stability, no more crash or stuck (I think?)<br>"
