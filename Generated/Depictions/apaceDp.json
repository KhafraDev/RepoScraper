Will mark track as loved with the Music app.\n\n\nAdd current track to a playlist from Control Centre and Lockscreen. You can choose to create a new playlist or select multiple ones. Select multiple by press and hold on a few playlists. When you are satisfied with the choice of playlists, simply pull down (as if you would refresh the table) to add them.\n\nYou can also choose to add directly to a prespecified playlist. It can check for duplicates.\n\nOn lockscreen, the playlist view will appear on the Today view. If you want to leave the view without adding to a playlist, just swipe back to the standard page and it will disappear.\n\n\nControl Spotify Connect devices in Control Centre's list of devices. It comes with the ability to change the icons amongst the standard ones Apple uses.\n\n\nAbility to control Offline Mode*, Incognito*, Shuffle** and Repeat by issuing a hold gesture on the album artwork.\n\n\nAutomatically fetches playlist images from Spotify's/Deezer's servers to show in the playlist view. If you don't want it to download them on your data plan you can choose to only download images on WiFi or only manually if you please so. It will also clean up leftovers if you decide to remove a playlist.\n\n\n\n\nWorks both in landscape and portrait mode.\nApace has support for Horseshoe (version 2.1.1). Not tested with Noctis but developed with it in mind. However, if any problems arise, feel free to contact me and I'll try to solve them as soon as possible.\n\nConfigure Apace in Settings."

					"markdown": "This item is now Free.\n\n\n\nSupport for Spotify 8.4.26 Testflight build 1.\n\n- Fixed crash on Spotify 8.4.24 and above.<br>\n- Fixed the messages section in Spotify appear on recent versions.<br>\n- Fixed freeze of SpringBoard when skipping several songs with Music.<br>\n- Made it possible to spam the like state again with Music.<br>\n\n• Fixed prespecified playlist with Music always being the last playlist.<br>\n• Fixed freezing of SpringBoard when spamming \"favorite track\" with Music. Simply calling Apple's implementation too often is causing this for some reason; therefore made it impossible to press the button with Music while a toast is showing.<br>\n• Fixed the playlist Playback History showing up several times on non-english devices with Music.<br>\n• Small updates to the preference panel.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n• Fixed a bug where a track wouldn't get added to a playlist on first attempt.<br>\n• Remade logic for prespecified playlist for all three apps. Make sure to reselect your playlist of choice.\n• Fixed crash of Deezer app.<br>\n• Added button in settings to delete all cached Spotify playlists. Use it to start fresh if any issue comes up with the playlist data.<br>\n• Support for Spotify version 8.4.12+ (rendered easy toggling of Offline Mode and Shuffle in Control Centre being deactivated for all users, not only non-premium ones).<br>\n• Fixes to playlist fetching and toast not showing on new playlist creation.<br>\n\nAdded support for Spotify version 8.4.11.<br>\nAdded section in Spotify's settings for past messages.<br>\nFixed AirPlay devices not showing up in Control Centre.<br>\nFixed a bug with Spotify's playlist fetching that made some playlists jump around.<br>\nFixed a crash of Preferences.app if a fetched playlist wouldn't have a name.<br>\n\nSupport for Spotify version 8.4.8 and 8.4.9. Rewrote everything besides the switches in the Spotify side of things.<br>\nFixed crash if a new playlist with empty name was specified.<br>\nFixed crash when opening the playlists view if MusicConnection was disabled.<br>\nFixed playlists images not being fetched on cellular regardless of setting.<br>\n\nEnabled ARC and fixed a memory leak which caused the device to respring after a few hours or days of usage (sorry for any inconvenience!).<br>\nFixed SB crash if playlist view was dismissed by unlock and track was changed afterwards.<br>\nAn attempt to fix Spotify crash when reading playlist data (I don't have this bug myself which complicates things - please send any crash logs).<br>\nFixes to Spotify Offline Mode, Shuffle and Repeat not updating properly on app launch.<br>\nInitial support for Sinatra.<br>\n\nRemoved some lagging in the playlist view when using the Music app.<br>\n<br>\nIt will now continue looking for an artwork through the playlist's tracks if the first track didn't have one. If people have very large playlists with not a single track with artwork, I might add a setting to use the system from yesterday's update (only show first track's artwork if any, otherwise none at all).<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFixed crash related to playlist images (Music).<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nMusic.app support<br>\nEarly support for future Acapella III updates<br>\nFixed lockscreen playlist view being blocked by the date<br>\nChanged icon in CC for Deezer to use a heart shaped one<br>\nUpdates collection icon on new track event (Deezer)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAdded support for Deezer, thus the name change. Worth noting: I couldn't figure out a good way to create a new playlists with Deezer, so that's disabled for the time being. Everything else should work. Moreover, I'm not gonna use Deezer myself, so if an update from Deezer comes and breaks something, I trust the community to let me know of any issues. Check my twitter for my status of awareness.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFixed a bug where Control Center's media page would turn visible again on change of track event. The playlist view will now be dismissed instead.<br>\n<br>\nVarious improvements here and there.<br>\n\n<br>\n<br>\nFixed crash on 1.0.3<br>\n<br>\nAccidently broke the blur background on the lockscreen when the iOS < 10.2 crash was fixed. The blur should be back now.<br>\n<br>\nIf no playlists were found it will no longer overwrite any already saved ones. This will hopefully ease the pain for those experiencing \"no playlists found\" pop up for the time being.<br>\n\n<br>\n<br>\nAdded option to disable the buttons on the first page of CC. Intended to be used with Horseshoe and Force Touch compatible devices.<br>\n<br>\nSome users experience the \"No playlists found\" popup. If you do and know how to manually install deb files, I would appreciate if you contacted me. The bug is not apparent on my device.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nPreviously disabled an incorrect row in the settings panel if no playlists were found. This resulted in a crash of settings.<br>\n<br>\nLooking for last index instead of checking for the string \"New playlist\", if you were to have a playlist named just that.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFixed crash on iOS 10.1.1. Thanks candoizo for noticing!"
