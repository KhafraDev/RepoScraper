These are in short mini notification badges (you can choose their shape too) that only show you that you have a notification, without the culture of numbering.\n\nis set to “light” mode by default and there is an option to switch to the light side or let Confero choose which one is better.\n\noption let the Confero Icon pulse when you get a notification.\n\ncan be hidden if there's not any notifications.\n\nIf you have issues with browsers please follow the guide in Confero's settings info page.\n\nFor anything, write us an e-mail to atomdevteam@yahoo.com\n\nThanks for your purchase!"
