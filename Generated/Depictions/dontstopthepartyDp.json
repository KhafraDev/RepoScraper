This means that when you respring your device you can continue jamming out to the music as your music will not be interrupted.\n\nKnown issue is using some streaming services you might witness a small pausing during resprings. This issue includes backgrounded Youtube videos and Beats One radio.\n\nThis tweak does NOT fix issues of apps interrupting your music, this does NOT allow you to use CCRecorder during resprings, this does NOT allow you to take video and listen to music at the same time."
