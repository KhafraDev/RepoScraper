Notably, this includes iTunes.\n\nThis tweak can prevent accidental updates/restores from iTunes, because iTunes will never be able to send your device into recovery in order to restore it!\n\nIn addition, it can also thwart potential thieves who have no idea how to enter DFU/recovery mode, and attempt to restore your device through iTunes when it is still booted up.\n\nDue to technical reasons, NO PLS RECOVERY cannot prevent or modify the DFU/recovery button combinations at boot.\n\nNO PLS RECOVERY doesmodify lockdownd, a critical system file, in any way. The modifications in this tweak are being achieved solely via Cydia Substrate."
