Check out.\n\nNextUp is a nice little enhancement that allows you to glimpse ahead of the current track and even change it if you don't like the what the future had in store for you.\n\nDon’t like a song? Skip it before it has even started playing.\n\nIt’s especially useful for those of you using free accounts with limited number of skips.\n\nSupported apps:\n\n\n\n\n\nCompatible with Flow, ColorFlow 4, Noctis and Sylph.\n\n* Skipping episodes in Podcasts is only possible with items that the user has manually added to the queue. This is due to the way the Podcasts app is built.\n\nNot working? See thefor known culprits.\n\nHaving an issue? Please report it at the public.\n\n\nSee larger Screenshots below.."
