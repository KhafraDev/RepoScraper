And iPhone X. iPads are tested on iOS 8.4 and 9.3.3.\n\nSnapper is a tweak that lets you crop a portion of the screen and keep it floating on the screen.\n\n\n\n- Never switching between two apps multiple times to enter a password ever again\n- Comparing stuff on the screen!\n- Instantly censoring an image that you want to share\n- Keep a reference to something while searching in e.g. Safari\n- Great for when you have a hard to spell word snapped that you need to enter somewhere\n- Take a screenshot of a small part of the screen only\n- Zoom unzoomable images\n- Can't copy text in some app? Just snap it and save to camera roll for later\n.. and more!\n\n\n\n- Control the area to crop before snapping!\n- Or don't - snapper has multiple modes\n- Costumizable\n- Use it with Activator, or without!\n- Never lose a snap, the history panel (access via Activator OR the Settings app)\n- Snaps organised by application snapped within\n- Multiple snaps on the screen at the same time\n- Facebook-heads-like interface to close snaps\n- Save to camera roll instantly\n- Sharing built-in\n- Automatically copy snap to clipboard (optional)\n- No DRM!\n- Awesome animations!\n.. and more!\n\n\n\nThis is what people have said about Snapper.\n\n>-&nbsp;feldrok_&nbsp;via&nbsp;reddit\n\n>-&nbsp;gonnabuysomewindows&nbsp;via&nbsp;reddit\n\n>-&nbsp;Fishy62&nbsp;via&nbsp;reddit\n\nConfigure options from Settings."
