This is supposed to mimic iOS 12.1, however I couldn't find the exact sound from 12.1, so it uses the sound that's given when scrolling through date/time pickers on stock iOS.\n\nCompatible with all iOS 11, iPhone X and older devices using HomeGesture.\n\nNo options to configure.\n\nNo Screenshots for this item."
